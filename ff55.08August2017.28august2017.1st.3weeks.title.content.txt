I
can't
find
my
bookmarks
on
my
Firefox.
I
tried
the
standard
restore
button
but
it
is
totally
blank.
No
backups
are
in
there.
How
do
I
restore
my
bookmarks??
My
bookmarks
suddenly
disappeared
from
Firefox
and
everything
seem
to
reset.
Even
my
homepage
went
back
to
firefox
default,
(instead
of
google)
I
followed
other
steps
trying
to
restore
my
bookmarks,
but
there
isn't
even
a
bookmark
restore
file.
It
just
cause
a
manuel
search
as
if
there
isn't
any
backups
available.
How
do
I
get
my
bookmarks
back??
What
is
the
point
of
being
able
to
choose
a
default
search
engine
if
it
keeps
reverting
to
yahoo?
In
effect
Yahoo
is
the
default.
I
keep
selecting
Google
as
my
preferred
default
search
engine
but
it
keeps
reverting
to
yahoo.
In
fact
I
remove
yahoo
at
the
same
time
but
it
keeps
coming
back.
In
reality
this
makes
yahoo
the
unchangeable
search
default
search
engine.
There
is
no
real
choice.
I've
used
Firefox
as
my
preferred
browser
for
so
many
years
I
can't
remember
and
this
is
a
new
problem.
I
will
go
find
another
browser
if
I
am
forced
to
accept
an
search
engine
that
I
do
not
want.
This
needs
sorting.
I
DON'T
WANT
YAHOO!!
Give
me
choice.
How
do
I
restore
my
bookmarks
which
were
all
lost
after
I
refreshed
Mozilla
Firefox?
All
of
my
bookmarks
disappeared
after
I
refreshed
Firefox.
I
tried
to
follow
the
directions
that
were
given
to
some
others
with
the
same
problem,
but
I
am
lost.
In
one
response,
it
was
recommended
to
delete
JSON
files,
but
I
was
afraid
to
delete
the
two
JSONLZ4
files
that
I
found
(somewhere).
I
thought
that
it
might
cause
my
bookmarks
to
completely
disappear.
Can
anyone
guide
me
through
the
process
to
restore
bookmarks
simply?
I
would
really
appreciate
your
help.
Thank
you.

Right-clicking
a
bookmark
inside
a
folder
automatically
opens
it
in
the
current
tab.
I
have
a
weird
problem
where
when
I
right-click
on
a
bookmark
to
bring
up
the
drop-down
menu
will
automatically
open
the
bookmark
in
the
current
tab
instead.
When
I
right-click
a
bookmark
I
want
to
select
'open
in
new
tab',
but
since
it
automatically
opens
in
the
current
tab,
it
replaces
my
current
tab
which
I
don't
want.
What
makes
this
problem
weird
is
that
it
doesn't
always
happen.
It
happens
about
50%
of
the
time
I
right-click
a
bookmark,
which
sometimes
shows
the
drop
down
menu,
allowing
me
to
open
it
in
another
tab.
This
also
only
occurs
for
bookmarks
inside
a
folder.
For
any
bookmarks
that's
not
inside
a
folder
this
doesn't
happen.
When
the
issue
occurs
the
drop
down
menu
flashes,
disappearing
instantly,
and
instead
opens
the
bookmark.
I'm
on
a
laptop
and
use
a
mousepad,
but
since
the
issue
differentiate
between
bookmarks
inside
and
outside
of
folders
I
don't
think
that
the
mousepad
is
the
issue.
My
question
is
simple.
How
do
I
prevent
this
from
happening?

Ubuntu
16.04
Hi,
Firefox
is
my
usual
browser
and
I
have
used
it
on
many
different
OSs.
The
first
thing
I
always
do
when
installing
Firefox
on
a
new
OS
is
ensure
that
the
Menu
Bar
(File,
Edit,
View
etc)
is
displayed
permanently.
Usually
this
is
not
a
problem,
but
on
Ubuntu
16.04
and
Firefox
54.0
this
is
giving
me
problems.
Usually
I
would
just
press
the
Alt
key
to
make
to
display
the
menu
bar
and
then
use
the
VIew
>
Toolbars
>
Menu
Bar
to
display
it
permanently.
(This
approach
worked
on
an
installation
of
Xubuntu
I
have
on
another
computer).
However
on
Ubuntu
pressing
Alt
brings
up
the
HUD
search
menu.
OK,
so
I
went
to
Settings
>
Keyboard
>
Shortcuts
and
turned
off
this
shortcut,
but
now
pressing
Alt
has
no
effect.
It
doesn't
display
the
HUD
and
it
doesn't
display
the
Menu
bar.
After
googling
around
I
determined
that
I
could
go
to
Open
Menu
>
Customize
>
Show
/
Hide
Toolbars
>
Menu
Bar.
This
seemed
like
a
winner,
but
when
I
open
the
Show
/
Hide
Toolbars
dropdown,
it
does
not
contain
the
Menu
Bar
as
an
option.
The
Bookmarks
Toolbar
is
the
only
option
here.
At
this
point
I
went
back
to
my
old
Xubuntu
(remember,
also
using
Firefox
54.0)
and
had
a
look
at
Open
Menu
>
Customize
>
Show
/
Hide
Toolbars.
In
Xubuntu
the
Menu
Bar
is
given
as
a
selectable
option.
Why
not
in
Ubuntu?
OK,
so
what
do
I
have
to
do
here?

mode

Trouble
upgrading
from

bit
to

bit
on
WIN
10
I
just
got
a
new
64
bit
WIN
10
laptop
and
downloaded
the
latest
firefox
from
mozilla.org
(July
2017)
and
somehow
mozilla.org
website
incorrectly
automatically
downloaded
and
installed
the
32

version
54
even
though
I
have
64
bit
WIN
10.
After
a
few
days
I
realizing
the
performance
problems
I
manually
downloaded
64
bit
firefox
55.
However
I
tried
uninstalling
firefox
32
bit
ver
54
and
It
wont
uninstall
because
it
keeps
falsely
detecting
that
firefox
is
running
and
wont
uninstall
while
it
thinks
its
running
-
Its
not
running
in
the

and
I
dont
know
why
it
wont
uninstall
and
the

package
will
not

package.
Any
and
all
suggestions
are
appreciated

something

of
that.
I
reinstalled
it
after

then

can

There

a

installing

no

How

Anti-virus
softwares
are
able
to
read
saved
passwords
in
Firefox.If
they
can,
then
anyone
can.This
raises
concerns
on
the
safety
of
passwords
Recently
my
Anti-virus
AVG
notified
me
that
I
use
similar
passwords
from
my
saved
passwords
in
Firefox.
Although
I
appreciate
the
service
of
AVG,
I
was
concerned
if
my
passwords
were
compromised.
If
AVG
can
check
my
saved
passwords,
anyone
can.
This
raises
concerns!
Can't
update
to
55.0,
and
Extensions
disappeared
Hello,
I
have
two
issues
and
think
they
might
be
related
somehow,
based
on
date
coincidence.
Earlier
today
I
successfully
updated
Firefox
on
my
Windows
10
computer
(54.0.1
to
55.0)
When
I
went
to
update
Firefox
on
my
Windows
7
computer,
it
tells
me
my
'Firefox
54.0.1
32-bit'
is
up
to
date.
Why
is
the
55.0
update
not
appearing?
I
worry
about
security
vulnerabilities,
am
I
at
risk
here?
The
second
issue
is
that
all
my
Extensions
no
longer
appear
under
'about:addons',
while
I
am
logged
into
my
standard
user
account.
Adblock
Plus
and
Fireshot
should
appear
here,
but
it
tells
me
'You
don't
have
any
add-ons
of
this
type
installed'.
However,
the
ABP
icon
appears
on
the
upper
right
of
the
browser
window,
and
is
working
properly.
I
keep
Fireshot
disabled
most
of
the
time,
only
enabling
it
when
I
need
it.
This
has
never
happened
before,
and
things
were
like
they
should
be
just
a
day
or
two
ago.
I
noticed
this
on
the
same
day
I
installed
Firefox
55.0
on
my
Windows
10
computer.
Oddly
enough,
on
Windows
10,
Firefox
marks
ABP
as
Legacy,
saying
that
a
big
change
is
coming
up
regarding
add-ons
in
November,
and
marks
Fireshot
as
not
compatible
with
this
version
of
Firefox.
However,
Firefox
55.0
hasn't
been
installed
on
my
Windows
7
computer.
I
have
automatic
updating
turned
off,
I
check
for
and
install
Firefox
updates
manually.
I'm
not
sure
what
to
do.
I'm
tempted
to
see
if
this
sorts
itself
out
if
I
wait,
or
when
I
can
install
the
55.0
update.
Any
assistance
you
can
give
me
is
appreciated...
My
bookmarks
have
disappeared
after
Mozilla
updated
my
browser.
It
appears
that

did
an

to

now
my

seems
to
be

get
the
pop-up
'The

How
can
I
turn
this
off?
I'm
connecting
on
my
wireless
network,
after
logging
in
on
the

I'm
being

I
get

with
the
following
security
warning:
'The
information
you
have
entered
on
this
page
will
be
sent
over

Is
there
a
manner
to
disable
it?
Can
I
use
something
via
about:config?
Why
does
it
log
me
off
every
site
when
there
is
an
update?

use

os

persistiu.
Cabe
dizer
que
antes
de

cheguei
a
tentar
voltar
à

houve
problema
ainda
maior
já
que
várias

começaram
a
ser
consideradas
inseguras
e
eram
impedidas
de

em

ocultos.

que
possam
ajudar,

já
não
tenho
idéia
do
que

fazer

Update
to
55.0
broke
a
lot
of
addons,
how
do
I
sole
this?
Hi
FF
Updated
to
55.0
yesterday
and
now
I
have
a
number
of
un-operational
addons.
The
most
immediate
problem;
I
had
Status-4-Evar
installed
and
had
Fox
clocks
and
Self-Destructing
Cookies
in
the
bottom
right
corner
of
the
FF
page.
I
would
like
to
have
both
functions
back
operating
where
I
had
them,
any
suggestions
about
how
I
can
do
this.
I
have
tried
the
customise
and
toolbars
options
but
although
Status-4-Evar
and
Self-Destructing
Cookies
are
there
I
cant
get
them
to
the
bottom
right
of
the
page
(they
will
go
into
the
top
toolbar)
and
although
Fox
Clocks
is
installed
it
doesn’t
actually
do
anything.
Thanks
I'm
not
able
to
send
emails
from
my
godaddy
account
as
of
today.
What
can
I
do?
I
was
able
to
send
emails
this
morning.
I
cleaned
out
my
cache/cookies
mid-day.
Also
lost
my
toolbar
but
added
it
back
in.
Ever
since,
I
can't
send
emails.
I
receive
them,
and
when
I
click
to
reply,
the
box
comes
up,
but
I
get
a
spinning
wheel
and
it
says
'loading'.
Any
ideas?
Thank
you!

before

a)since
it
consumes
a
lot
more
cpu
memory
and
hogs
down
the
system
b)the
default
play
is
360p
which
also
consumes
lot
of
data
and
requires
a
more
bandwidth.
c)even
if
you
don`t
want
to
watch
full
video
the
buffering
never
stops.
d)if
you
open

tabs
all
tabs
are
by
default
start

play
which
cannot
be
turned
off
either
in
config
or

i
want
to

to

i
have
restore
section
in
which
older
tabs
are
saved
if
i
update
will
it
be
lost.(how
to

that
)
if

can

suggest
the
fix
for
above
problems
with

kindly

Miksi
kolme
tyhjää
ikkunaa
jää
avoimeksi
,
kun
suljen
sivuston
ja
ne
pitää
vielä
erikseen
sulkea?
Aikasemmin
kaikki
ikkunat
sulkeutuivat
kun
sulki
ensinmäistä
ikkunaa,
kone
kysyi
vain
varmistuksen
suljetaanko
kaikki
ikkunat.
Nykyinen
toiminto
on
semmonen,
kun
aukaisee
alotussivun
ja
sittea
avaa
kirjamerkistä
esim:
e-mailin,
niin
samalla
ilmestyy
firefoxin

sivuun
pari

lisää
ja
siitä

että
taas
on
kolme
tyhjää
ikkunaa
odottamassa
sulkemista
erikseen???

eye
strain
problem
Firefox
55
is
too
bright
for
me,
or
maybe
it
contains
some
new
graphic
filter:
I
have
an
eye
strain
problem,
so
I
have
returned
to
Firefox
54.
It's
the
first
time
that
it
happens
to
me
during
all
the
firefox
versions
that
I
have
updated.
Some
more
hypothesis:
maybe
the
problem
it's
a
different
kind
of
rendering,
or
a
different
kind
of
blurring
during
zoom,
or
some
forms
of
flickering
(that
human
eye
can't
see).
I
don't
know.
Coders
should
know
if
something
has
changed.
Few
more
info:
usually,
I
have
eye
strain
problems
with
screens
brightness
(so,
I
always
use
a
very
low
brightness,
'under
0'.
I
mean:
graphic
cards
can
bring
brightness
more
down
than
basic
monitor
options);
and
I
have
heavy
eye
strain
problems
with
antialiasing
and
all
its
derivated
forms
(bilinear,trilinear
and
anisotropic
filtering,
ambient
occlusion,
HDR
illumination,
depth
of
field
etc.
etc.),
but
I
don't
think
this
is
the
case:
for
me,
it's
a
common
problem
with
some
videogames,
but
programs
usually
are
made
'clean'
(in
relation
to
these
problematics).
In
15
years,
I
have
had
problems
with
no
more
than
6
programs
(and
I
have
used
hundreds
of
programs).

The

Doesn't

The
new
version
of
the
Mozilla
Plug-in
update
page
now
only
shows
when
you
need
to
update
your
version
of
Firefox.
The
Adobe
Flash
plug-in
update
disappeared.
How
do
I
know
when
it
needs
updated
now?
It's
a
pain
to
keep
checking
the
adobe.com
site.
But
since
I
just
had
a
new
Firefox
update,
along
with
windows,
etc.
I
checked
and
there
is
a
new
Adobe
Flash
update
that
now
doesn't
show
on
the
plug-in
page.
Even
my
Avast
software
updater
doesn't
show
it
yet.
So
how
does
one
go
about
checking
for
that
update
now,
unless
it's
like
I
said
and
I
have
to
keep
checking
the
adobe
site.
I
haven't
updated
the
Adobe
Flash
plug-in
yet
as
so
far
my

seem
to
be
working.
I'm
hesitating
until
I'm
sure
it's
okay
to
do
so.
Thanks
for
any
answers
to
this.
Maybe
it's
a
dumb
question.

it
with
both

the

The
problem
exists
in
both

Why
does
it
zoom
in
and
out
when
I
use
the

to
scroll
up

I
have

when
I

my

it
zooms
the

I

HELP!
firefox
random
crashes
-
AMD
machine
not
Intel
machine
Hi
all,
I've
been
using
Firefox
for
a
number
of
years
now
and
**love
it**!
I
have
one
issue
with
it
I
cannot
seem
to
fix
:(
Basically
Firefox
just
started
crashing
suddenly
one
day
a
couple
of
years
back,
seemingly
randomly
with
one
of
my
machines
:(
It
started
when
my
AMD
based
machine
was
running
14.04,
I
wasn't
bothered
as
I
had
a
Intel
machine
built
from
junk
I
was
using
and
tinkering
with;
basically
I
installed
Gnome
Ubuntu
16.04
LTS
on
the
Intel
box,
and
Firefox
is
rock
solid
-
always.
I
assumed
my
crashes
were
simply
a
corrupt
14.04
install
that
needed
rebuilding
on
the
AMD
machine.
So
I
wiped
the
AMD
machine
installed
16.04
LTS,
fresh
profile,
the
lot,
and
expected
not
to
be
troubled
with
crashes
again
on
the
AMD
machine...
Unfortunately
not,
fresh
build,
fresh
profile,
patched
up
to
date
it
still
randomly
crashes
:(
The
report
ID
I
have
is
https://crash-stats.mozilla.com/report/index/bp-1f9fc8f6-8c80-4ad2-b05d-fb2db0170809
I
am
quite
a
good
technician
but
this
is
beyond
me,
so
if
anyone
could
spare
some
insight
I
would
be
incredibly
grateful,
thank
you.

Since
the
update
on
8/8/2017,
I
cannot
close
Firefox
unless
I
use
Task
Manager.
Can
this
be
fixed?
I
have
tried
to
reinstall
Firefox,
but
regardless
of
my
efforts,
I
am
unable
to
close
Firefox
using
the
normal
methods.
The
only
way
I
can
close
it
is
to
use
Task
Manager
or
the
Close
Window
command
on
the
toolbar.
Neither
the
'File',
'Exit'
nor
the
'Close
box'
allow
the
program
to
terminate.
What
can
be
done
to
fix
this
issue?

In
the

sometimes
when
using
the

the
audio
drastically
slows
down,
like
the
way
a

sounds
when
it
is

get
the
audio
to
come
back
to
normal
speed.
It's
not
a
big

but
I'm
just
curious
why
this
may
happen.
I
haven't
experienced
this
with

or
anything
else
really.
Does
anyone
know
why
this
may
be
happening?

talking
about.

using

well.

Why
am
I
unable
to
get
to
a
website
that
I
have
used
many
times
in
the
past
and
you
have
decided
that
it
is
not
secure???
I
know
the
risks,
open
the
site!!
I
have
been
using
Palace
Premier
and
Palace
Elite
sites
for
the
past
5
or
6
years.
Now
You
have
decided
that
Palace
Elite
is
unsecured
and
whatever?
I
have
unblocked
as
much
as
I
could,
but
am
still
unable
to
get
into
the
site.
I
know
the
risks
and
can
and
have
accepted
them.
I
would
like
to
plan
a
vacation
which
I
have
done
many
times
in
the
past,
using
the
same
site.
I
do
have
a
code
and
password
for
each
site.
If
this
means
I
have
to
go
to
Microsoft's
email,
so
be
it.
update

One
of
my

to
version
55
yesterday.

says

and
will
not

SEC_ERROR_BAD_SIGNATURE
on
private
CA
certificates
Was
there
a
recent
change
that
invalidates
private
certificates,
with
it's
private
CA
imported
into
my
FF
CA
repository?
What
I
have
set
up,
which
worked
not
too
long
ago,
which
was
defining
the
IP
address
and
host
name
in
C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts
file.
Then
importing
the
remote
site's
private
CA
certificate
in
FF.
From
that
point
on,
it
trusted
my
private
URLs
due
to
matching
private
CA.
Now,
generates
SEC_ERROR_BAD_SIGNATURE.
I
renamed
the
cert8.db
file
and
restarted
FF.
I
now
get
the
normal
'untrusted'
error
then
re-imported
the
private
CA
to
make
the
'untrusted'
error
go
away.
However,
that
still
gave
me
SEC_ERROR_BAD_SIGNATURE.
So,
something
must've
changed.
I
even
tried
disabling
OCSP
checking
(thought
it
was
optional
if
it
couldn't
check).
I
then
disabled
OCSP
Stapling.
Neither
resolved
this
issue,
thinking
it
was
trying
to
check
with
the
OCSP
server,
which
it
can't
reach
due
to
firewall
since
it's
internal
to
the
other
private
LAN.
I'm
not
sure
where
to
look.
I
tried
Googling
for
answers,
which
lead
me
to
the
above
two
solutions
to
try.
The
CA
I
have
is
a
private
CA,
generated
by
Microsoft
Windows
Server
2008
R2
with
the
Active
Directory
Certificate
Authority
installation.
Like
I
said,
it
was
working
in

fairly
recently.
Let
me
know
what
else
you
need
for
me
to
provide.

Is

Which
is
the

I
followed
this
instruction:
Finding

On

click

menu,
hold

select

A

will
open
containing
your

Open
the
'Application

then
open
the

folder,
and
then
the
'Profiles'
folder.
Your
profile
folder
is
within
this
folder.
If
you
only
have
one

its
folder
would
have
'default'
in
the
name.
However
when
I
navigated
to

I
found
TWO
folders
with

If
yes,
how
?
The
main
use
of
the
PC
in
my
living
room
is
as
a
media
center.
My
GUI
(Plex)
runs
in
the
browser
and
plays
videos
with
VLC
via
a
custom
addon.
Currently
it
is
also
used
for
browsing
from
time
to
time
and
I
need
to
keep
that
part
of
it
secure.
As
Mozilla
is
about
to
break
all
my
addons
as
well
as
force
me
onto
64
bit,
I've
no
choice
but
to
stop
updating
Firefox
on
that
PC.
I
found
a
old
post
(3
years
old)
about
running
two
different
versions
of
Firefox
at
the
same
time.
https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/974208
Is
it
still
possible
to
do
this?
Does
the
same
methods
still
work?
I
want
to
freeze
my
current
32
bit
Firefox
at
v54.0.1
and
use
it
only
for

(I've
already
disabled
updates
on
it)
Then
I
want
to
then
install
a
second
64
bit
Firefox
v55,
use
it
for
internet,
and
allow
it
to
update
normally.
If
this
isn't
possible
I'll
just
have
to
switch
to
a
different
browser.

Hi,
My

crashing,
from
what
I
can
see
in

it

It
seems
to
be

Like,

It's
not
just
one
web

that
fails.
I've
got
several
crash
reports,
that
all
seem
to
crash
due
to
nvwgf2umx.dll
From
what
I've
been
able
to
read,
this
dll
is
a
graphics
driver
from
Nvidia.
I've
tried
reinstalling
the
driver
without
luck.
Also
tried
CCleaner
and
various
adware/malware
software
to
clean
my
pc,
again
no
luck.
Also
checked
the

of
my

Are

I'm
concerned
about
my
privacy
while
browsing
the
web,
and
for
my
general
browsing
I
have
a
special
configuration
similar
to
the
one
presented
here:
https://gist.github.com/atcuno/3425484ac5cce5298932
Basically
I
have
a
couple
of
add-ons
that
help
to
reduce
tracking
and
advertising,
a
user-agent
spoofer,
and
other
builtin
privacy
settings
(like
clearing
cookies
on
close).
I
am
primarily
concerned
with
making
sure
every
web
search,
article
I
read,
or
visit
to
a
web
site
with
trackers
is
not
connected
to
one
persistent
browser
fingerprint
or
id
that
can
be
also
connected
with
my
real-life
identity.
Now,
whether
or
not
these
efforts
keep
me
safe
from
the
persistent
profile
that
can
be
tracked
is
a
question
for
another
time.
***What
I
want
to
know
is
if
another
'profile'
in
the
Firefox
profile
manager
for
online
logins
associated
with
my
real-life
identity
(bank,
email,
spotify,
library,
etc.)
will
somehow
ooze
into
the
'private'
profile
I
created.
***
The
'login'
profile
won't
have
all
of
the
privacy
addons
and
settings
as
the
'private'
profile,
because
they
too-easily
break
logins,
and
because
the
profile
will
already
be
associated
with
my
real-life
identity,
so
I
don't
plan
on
using
it
except
to
browse
those
sites.
Cookies
will
be
allowed
to
stay,
and
no
more
than
basic
adblocking.
Previously
I
used
Chromium
for
this
purpose,
but
I
don't
want
to.
Firefox
works
better
in
many
ways.
It
seems
like
I
should
be
safe
doing
this,
as
each
new
profile
appears
to
have
a
completely
blank
configuration
and
cookie
jar,
but
better
safe
than
sorry,
right?
THANK
YOU
for
looking
at
my
question
and
I
hope
you
can
help!
I
have
restored
my

I

Can
you

Hello,
I
really
need
help
with
this
one.
I
installed
firefox
on
a
new
computer
and
used
the
sync
function
to
get
all
my
bookmarks
etc.
back.
Now,
I
was
playing
around
in
the
Library
and
I
mistakenly
ran
a
backup
file
which
got
created
automatically
around
the
time
I
installed
firefox.
It
only
contained
the
default
bookmarks
so
it
deleted
all
of
my
stuff
and
now
I'm
stuck
with
the
default
bookmarks
and
2
backup

At

I
made
sure
that
none

all

I
checked

yet
it
still

I
read
through

the

both
of
which
instructed
me
to
check

however
it

and
there

Is
there

Hello,
I
was
looking
thought
firefox
for
pc
customization
options,
eg
addons,
tab
bar
customisation
etc.
and
i
noticed
that
there
is
no

customisation
when
you
open
the

to
the

Could
this
possibly
be
an
option?
Personally
i
think
it
would
give
a
more
personal
feel
to
the
users
of

as
myself.
Furthermore
if
it

to

the

to

Why
does
https://odb.org/
come
up
blank
sometimes,
and
I
have
to
clear
my
cache?
This
is
NOT
user-friendly!
ODB
changes
the
page
EVERY
day.
Every
day
I
start
the
day
by
reading
Our
Daily
Bread
online
at
ODB.ORG.
About
once
every
two
weeks
the
page
comes
up
blank
in
Firefox,
but
loads
in
ie,
so
I
have
to
go
to
tools
and
advanced
and
clear
cache,
sometimes
twice
or
three
times,
before
I
can
finally
load
the
page,
which
changes
DAILY.
This
is
NOT
user-friendly.
How
can
I
modify
Firefox
to
automatically
ignore
the
cache
for
frequently
loading
pages,
such
as
ODB.ORG?

where
it
does
work
without
requesting
me
every

time
to

from
this,
my

product
works
perfectly
in

When

is

ONLY
that

are

how
do
I
uninstall
onlineMapFinder
and
FromDoctoPDF
toolbar?
I
have
inadvertently
installed
a
new
toolbar
called
OnlineMapFinder
and
FromDoctoPDF
which
I
wish
I
hadn't.
I
am
unable
to
hide
them
and
can't
find
them
to
uninstall
in
the
App
section
of
Settings.
Googling
how
to
uninstall
them
I
get
a
message
that
suggested
sites
providing
information
are
unsecure.
Can
you
help
me
get
rid
of
these
Please?
When
I
try
to
open
a
downloaded
webpage,
I
get
a
message
that
Javascript

I'm
trying
to
download
a
webpage
for
offline
use,
but
when
I
try
to
open
it
from
my

I
get
a
message
that

I'm
guessing
that
maybe
this
has
to
do
with
the
fact
that
the
page
is
from
school
and
it's
behind
a
login.
Is
there
any
workaround
to
open
the
page,
or
am

Is
there
another

that
will

Firefox
hangs
when
multiple
tabs
are
being
loaded,
only
in
normal
windows.
-
Firefox
hangs,
exclusively
whenever
I
tried
to
open
and
load
multiple
tabs.
It
never
happens
in
other
situations.
-
This
happens
only
in
the
'normal
window',
and
doesn't
happens
in
the
'private
window'.
It
is
also
slower
in
the
'normal
window'
than
in
the
'private
window'.
Maybe
the
key
of
my
problem
lay
in
the
differences
between
how
normal
and
private
windows
works.
-
It
doesn't
only
happens
when
there
are
many(say,
more
than
20)
tabs
are
already
opened.
It
also
hangs
when
I
fresh
start
the
Firefox
with
no
pre-opened
tab.
-
I
tried
every
measures
which
Mozilla
support
provide
officially.
This
includes
safe
mode,
refreshing
the
browser(all
the
settings
are
now
at
default),
turning
off
hardware
acceleration,
etc.
Nothing
has
worked.
-
I
don't
think
that
my
computer's
memory
and
CPU
can
be
a
source
of
the
problem.
I
have
16GB
ram,
i7-5500U
processor,
which
is
more
than
enough
to
run
Firefox,
of
course.
And
I
don't
run
any
resource
exhausting
heavy
programs.
I
just
use
browsers,
and
some
word-processors.
Plus,
this
never
happens
with
Chrome,
and
chrome
consumes
even
more
memory
and
CPU
resources
than
Firefox.
Conclusively,
Firefox
doesn't
occupies
so
much
memory
or
CPU
resources
when
it
hangs.
Actually
I
prefer
the
Firefox
to
occupy
more
resources,
if
it
can
avoid
this
annoying
hang
problem.
I
have
no
idea
what
could
be
the
source
of
the
problem.
Maybe
I
should
just
be
patient
with
the
problem
until
next
major
update
to
version
57.
If
anyone
had
a
similar
problem
and
fixed
it,
please
let
me
know.

After
I
wrote
this
question,
I
altered
configuration
to
allow
Firefox
to
load
multiple
tabs
in
the
background,
by
switching
'browser.sessionstore.restore_on_demand'
setting
in
the
'about:config'
to
false
from
true(default).
So
far,
the
browser
certainly
uses
more
memory
but
don't
hang.

August

Firefox
update
not
working
properly
I
had
an
update
to
Firefox
on
8/8/17.
I
am
now
having
problems
using
a
game
in
Facebook.
The
game,
Mystery
Manor
Hidden
Adventure,
takes
forever
to
load
and
once
it
does,
Firefox
locks
up
and
I
have
to
do
an
'End
Task'.
The
game
developers
have
checked
my
game
and
there
is
no
problem
on
their
end.
The
problem
with
the
game
started
after
the
update.
I
have
updated
Adobe
Flashplayer,
and
have
the
add-on
for
Firefox.
How
do
I
fix
this
problem?
I
have
never
had
a
problem
with
this
game
on
Firefox
before.
A
powerful
'door'
has
opened
in
browser
allowing
in
adware
Ever
since
recent
browser
update,
I
noticed
that
the
lettering
in
the
top
drop
down
menu
was
vanishing,
in
a
downward
progression.
So
to
with
my
Book
marks
files.
I
can
run
the
cursor
down
the
list
and
see
the
line,
but
not
as
normal.
I
ran
Malwarebytes
and
found
nothing.
Did
a
complete
virus
scan
via
Avast
and
found
nothing.
I
ran
the
SUPERAntiSpyware
program
and
found
several
hundred
adware
cookies
(I
seldom
had
more
than
30
or
40
previously).
Using
the
Quick
Scan
(common
points
of
infection)
I
found
and
deleted
the
cookies.
But
the
problem
would
slowly
manifest
itself
again.
I
again
ran
the
Quick
Scan
and
again
found
over
a
100
adware
cookies.
This
time,
immediately
after
deleting
them,
I
ran
the
Critical
Point
Scan
(active
infections)
and
found
there
were
still
46
adware
cookies
in
the
file.
Immediately
after
deleting
them,
I
ran
the
Complete
Scan
(all
files)
and
found
54
adware
cookies
STILL
remaining!
Now
...
as
far
as
computers
go,
I
almost
need
a
dictionary
to
even
spell
computer,
but
I
did
note
one
common
aspect
of
the
file
and
that
it
had
the
same
section
of
'...\\Profiles\\9QQZKPWP.DEFAULT\\...'
.
I
attach
screenshots
of
the
antispyware
scan
results.
This
begins
even
if
no
other
programs
are
being
accessed,
like
Facebook
and
such.
Clear
history
by
container
I
use
a
lot
Shift+Ctrl+Del
to
bring
the
Clear
All
History
popup
and
clear
all
recent
activity.
And
now
I'm
starting
to
use
the
Containers
feature
(very
nice
addition!).
The
issue
is
that
the
Clear
All
History,
clear
all
data
from
all
Containers.
Would
be
nice
to
have
a
combo
on
the
popup
to
select
the
Container
to
clear,
and
may
be
start
with
the
one
where
the
hot
key
was
selected.

Fix
issues
with
version
55.0
update
and
webmail
Since
the
Firefox
version
55.0
update
my
Cox
Enhanced
WebMail
no
longer
works
properly.
I've
found
three
problems
so
far.
1.
When
I
open
an
email,
after
I
click
on
a
link
and
then
go
back
to
my
WebMail
the
email
box
shrinks,
offsets
to
left-side
of
window,
images
no
longer
show
(only
links),
and
I
cannot
close
the
box.
Note:
screenshot
attached.
2.
While
WebMail
is
open,
but
not
an
email,
if
I
switch
to
another
tab
or
window
and
then
go
back
to
WebMail
I
no
longer
can
open
any
emails.
3.
If
I
open
an
email
I
cannot
close
it
using
the
'x'
box.
I
can
only
delete
the
message.
The
only
way
to
get
out
of
the
errors
listed
above
is
to
hit
'refresh'.
I
can
then
hit
the
'logout'
button.
Note:
here
is
the
address
for
the
web
page:
https://webtop.west.cox.net/.
I
have
tried
all
of
the
following,
with
no
success,
to
fix
these
issues:
refreshing
Firefox;
opened
in
Safe
Mode
(note:
WebMail
requires
Flash,
so
this
definitely
didn't
work!);
cleared
cache
and
cookies;
reset
zoom;
and
checked
that
Flash
is
current.
Note:
this
only
happens
with
Firefox
and
not
other
browsers.
Facebook
shows
me
logged
in
from
another
location.
How
do
I
fix
this?
I
have
a
default
location
set
in
Win10,
but
when
logged
into
Facebook,
my
settings
show
me
logged
in
somewhere
else.
firefox
hangs
on
'transfering
data
from
ping.chartbeat.net'
when
downloading
sometimes
it
hangs
on
'transfering
data
from
dd6zx4ibg538kcloudfront.net'
.
This
all
seems
to
have
started
after
I
did
a
Firefox
'cleanup'
run.
Flash
player
not
working
on
any
site
Can
not
view
any
flash
video.
Current
flash
player
installed
and
current.
In
Windows
10
Firefox
is
not
coming
up
when
I
click
on
it.
When
I
then
click
on
Chrome,
after
Chrome
comes
up
then
the
Firefox
browser
comes
up.
After
booting
up
my
desktop,
when
I
click
on
Firefox,
the
browser
will
not
come
up.
When
I
then
click
on
Google
Chrome
and
the
Google
Chrome
browser
comes
up,
then
Firefox,
after
a
few
minutes,
comes
up.
Once
Firefox
comes
up,
it
is
slow
and
not
responding.
Which
is
what
is
says,
'not
responding'.
I
know
the
problem
is
not
my
computer
alone,
because
at
the
office
Firefox
does
not
come
up
when
I
click
it.
In
addition,
before
the
last
windows
upgrade,
when
I
could
finally
get
into
Firefox
and
while
checking
my
email,
I
would
get
a
screen
wiping
out
my
email
asking
me
to
download
software.
I
have
the
Firefox
setting
on
automatic
updates,
so
getting
this
message
was
annoying.
I
thought
it
was
a
virus
and
did
not
download
the
software.
I
am
not
an
IT
or
Tech
person
and
have
limited
knowledge
of
computer
software/hardware.
I
just
know
it
does
not
work
and
it
is
slow.
I
don't
want
to
use
Google
Chrome.
I
would
love
for
this
to
be
fixed.
Latest
flash
update
crashes
firefox
Flash
updated
yesterday
to
v26_0_0_151
and
since
then
everything
crashes
with
flash
and
freezes
Firefox.
I
get
continuous
'unresponsive
warnings'.
I
have
'Flash
protected
mode'
turned
off.
I
tried
reinstalling
previous
versions
of
flash
but
those
don't
work
either,
even
tho
they
worked
in
the
past.
I
don't
know
what
to
do.
Any
help
would
be
appreciated.
Yahoo
keeps
coming
back.
No
matter
how
often
I
follow
your
instructions
to
change
the
default
browser
to
Google.
How
can
I
reach
into
Firefox,
to
manually
kill
it?
A
shadow-like
line
appears
under
the
location
bar
when
I
enter
an
address
or
search
topic
The
shadow-like
line
appears
as
if
it's
trying
to
suggest
something
for
my
search
topic.
I
disabled
the
option
to
suggest
me
from
my
history,
but
Firefox
can
suggest
me
from
my
'bookmarks'
and
'open
tabs'.
I
also
disabled
the
option
'Show
search
suggestions
in
location
bar
results'
from
'preferences---search'.
Is
this
why
it's
happening?
Or
is
it
a
bug?
I
tried
with
default
settings
that
I've
mentioned
just
now,
but
the
issue
remains...
I
can't
even
provide
a
screen-shot
because
the
line
disappears
as
soon
as
I've
pressed
the
screen-shot
button,
same
result
when
I'm
using
a
screen-shot
taking
tool!
I've
noticed
this
issue
just
recently,
I
can't
really
remember
the
first
time
it
appeared...

running
slow
after
update,
using
lots
of
disk
After
the
latest
windows
update,
Firefox
has
been
running
unbelievably
slow.
I've
tried
refreshing,
reinstalling,
updating

turning
off

and
just
about
everything
else
that's
been
mentioned
on
this

Chrome/edge
work
perfectly,
and
the
only
suspicious
performance
issues
involve
my
hard
drive
usage
spiking
to
the
70%
range
whenever
firefox
is
loading
a
page
(albeit
painfully
slowly).
Memory
and
CPU
usage
is
similar
across
web
browsers,
but
chrome/edge
don't
cause
a
spike
in
disk
usage.
In
addition
to
the
slowdown,
my
bookmarks
have
all
but
vanished.
Attempts
to
back
them
up
result
in
a
'unable
to
process
this

error
message.
I've
tried
uninstalling
and
deleting
as
many

as
possible;
program
files,
old

etc..
prior
to
reinstalling,
and
still
the
same
problem
exists.
Firefox
still
works
wonderfully
on
my
laptop,
which
hasn't
been
updated,
but
is
seemingly
permanently
laggy
on

Gah.
Your
tab
just
crashed.
Hello,
recently
I
have
been
getting
this
message
a
short
time
after
opening
Firefox.
It
looks
like
the
attached
picture.
Based
on
what
I
have
seen,
crash
reports
can
help
get
to
the
root
of
the
problem,
however,
Firefox
doesn't
seem
to
be
generating
crash
reports
after
these
tab
crashes.
Can
anyone
help
me
with
both
of
these
issues?
How
do
shut
off
all
ads?
I
do
not
want
any
suggestions
on
what
to
purchase
or
a
listing
of
any
of
my
previous
product
searches.
This
is
annoying
and
an
invasion
of
my
privacy.
Thank
you.

a

lag
between

and

despite

I
made
no

now
Firefox
responds
so
slowly
to

(eg
right
to
use
'Paste'

that

large
memory
usage
with
Firefox
55
I
have
noticed
high
memory
usage
from
the
firefox
55
install,
are
you
going
to
patch
this
issue
soon?
I
welcome
the
change
to
the
new
technology,
but
as
many
dev
make
add
ons
in
their
spare
time,
could
you
make
some
incentives
for
them
to
update
to
the
new
tech?
With
the
new
version
of
today,
55,
the
Firefox
browser
is
greatly
faster,
but
many
of
my
add
ons,
which
are
a
crucial
part
of
my
browser
experience
are
of
the
old
technology
and
will
sease
to
work
after
57.
As
many
of
the
developers
write
their
add
ons
in
their
free
time,
I
think
for
a
smoother
transition
you
could
make
some
incentives
for
the
developers
to
update
or
hire
developers
yourself
that
help
the
add
on
devs
to
rewrite
and
renew
their
code
to
fit
the
future
versions.
I
really
hope
you
consider
that
as
me
and
many
other
Firefox
users
are
already
freaking
out
at
the
perspective
that
many
of
the
add
ons
will
be
incompatible
in
november.

Firefox
crashes
Crash
ID:
bp-62345ecf-12f1-4f7e-9ecb-0a67b1170810
Installed
Firefox
64
bit,
unistalled
32
bit
and
lost
bookmarks
and
session
info.
How
do
I
get
them
back?
First,
I
read
on
Mozilla
Firefox
support
how
to
upgrade
from
32
bit
Firefox
to
64
bit
Firefox.
Very
simple.
However,
after
I
installed
the
64
bit,
I
didn't
have
my
bookmarks
or
my
sessions
restored.
Now,
despite
having
selected
in
options,
startup
to
'show
my
windows
and
tabs
from
last
time'
it
will
not.
It
always
starts
with
a
blank
slate.
I
re-installed
Firefox
32
bit
and
it
is
behaving
the
exact
same
way.
The
only
thing
it
seems
to
have
retained
is
my
add-ons
and
extensions.
I
am
really
disappointed
with
Firefox.
Here
I
was
trying
to
improve
performance
in
Firefox
and
instead
everything
has
gone
to
s**t.
I
looked
in
the
folder
where
my
Firefox
data
and
bookmarks
are
stored
and
everything
appears
to
still
be
there.
Also,
tried
in
Firefox
64
bit
to
restore
bookmarks.
I
selected
a
date
from
a
list
(
the
most
recent)
and
it
said
something
went
wrong
and
did
not
restore
the
bookmarks.
What
the
heck
has
gone
wrong?
Help
would
be
most
appreciated.
Why
do
my
tabs
keep
crashing?

Unwanted

Monitor
Activity
(Mac
OS
10.6)
Hi
there,
I've
come
to
notice
that
in
the
'Files&Open
Ports'
pane
in
my
Firefox
process
in
the
Activity
Monitor
there
is
a
lot
of
lines
that
–correct
me
if
I
am
wrong–
I
guess
should
not
be
there.
I
am
suspecting
that
could
be
the
culprits
of
the
browser's
sluggish
beahviour
but
I
am
not
sure
at
all.
There
are
a
lot
of
lines
that
seem
to
refer
to
fonts,
like
this
ones:
/\\xe2\\x80\\xa2TIPOS\\xe2\\x80\\xa2/WhateverFoundry/WhateverFontFamily/WhateverFontstyle.otf
example:
/\\xe2\\x80\\xa2TIPOS\\xe2\\x80\\xa2/GOOGLE
WEBFONTS/Playfair
Display/PlayfairDisplay-Regular.otf
They
are
also
sorted
'by
foundry'
in
a
way
that
resembles
my
current
font
folder
organization.
Maybe
can
this
be
related
to
a
font
cache
issue?
Because
I
do
not
think
the
browser
needs
such
a
huge
amount
of
fonts
to
work
properly...
Is
there
a
way
to
fix
it?
(In
case
a
fix
is
even
needed...)
Thanks!

Hi!
Here's
a
GREAT
idea
for
a
version
of
FF!
I
often
need
to
launch
FF
just
to
find
a
quick
answer,
download
a
simple
file,
check
my
email
or
something
else
very
simple,
and
get
right
back
out.
I
don't
want
any
add-ons
or
extensions,
of
which
I
have
a
slew
installed
on
my
normal
FF;
I
just
want
a
very
stripped-down
version
of
FF
without
a
single
bell
or
whistle
so
it
loads
instantly
and
is
fast
as
blazes.
Can
you
strip
a
version
down
so
it
is
the
simplest
browser
anywhere
and
offer
it
like
nightly/developer/beta?
I
know
I
can
load
FF
without
any
of
my
extensions
loading
with
a
startup
option,
but
that
will
still
load
the
entire
FF
code
base,
right?
I
want
a
tiny
version
of
FF
that
only
contains
absolutely
critical
code
loading.
For
example,
allow
only
2
Tabs,
no
theme
support,
no
searching
to
see
if
it's
the
default
browser,
no
home
page
selection
or
previous
tabs
to
open--opens
only
to
it's
own
homepage
every
time,
only
the
computer's
default
language,
doesn't
track
history
or
bookmarks
by
default,
MUCH
simpler
settings,
not
all
the
options
of
normal
FF,
just
a
stripped-down
SIMPLE
version
for
like
your
great
grandma.
Only
load
the
code
that
is
critical
and
if
other
code
is
needed,
load
it
on
call.
What
do
you
think?
Thanks,
Eric

How
to
restore-
MAC?
My
MAC
crashed
and
I
lost
all
of
my
important
tabs
that
were
up
at
the
time
-
about
50
or
so
that
goes
back
over
six
months,
I
went
to
history
to
restore
and
it
was
grayed
out
and
not
available
like
usual.
Is
there
another
way
to
restore
my
old
tabs?
Thanks

Chci
synchronizovat
záložky
na
3
zařízeních
-
domácí
a
pracovní
NTB
a
telefon.
Jak
nastavit,
který
obsah
je
primární
a
chci
ho
sdílet
do
ostatních?
Nejdříve
jsem
používal
domácí
notebook
a
v
něm
si
vytvořil
nějaké
záložky
apod.
Pak
jsem
začal
používat
Firefox
i
v
práci
a
opět
si
vytvořil
nějaké
záložky,
odlišné
od
těch
domácích.
No
a
teď,
když
jsem
začal
používat
Firefox
i
na
mobilu,
jsem
se
rozhodl
sdílet
nastavení,
záložky
atd.
Notebook
v
práci
je
pro
mě
primární,
tedy
chci
aby
v
ostatních
zařízeních
bylo
vše
dle
toho,
co
mám
v
něm.
Ale
ouha,
z
neznámého
důvodu
se
Firefox
rozhodl,
že
primární
bude
to
co
mám
v
domácím
NTB.
Stačí
otevřít
Firefox
na
mobilu
a
v
tu
ránu
se
mi
vše
v
pracovním
NTB
změní
na
domácí
nastavení.
To
jednoduše
napravím
obnovením
automatické
historie.
Ale
jakmile
znovu
otevřu
domácí
NTB,
nebo
telefon,
opět
se
mi
vše
v
pracovním
NTB
změní.
Ve
Firefoxu
přitom
není
nikde
možnost,
jak
určit
primární
zařízení
-
prostě
si
Firefox
určil,
že
ten
první
NTB
je
primární
a
podle
toho
jede.
Už
jsem
i
zkoušel
vymyzat
kompletně
vše
a
odhlásit
se
z
domácího
NTB,
přeinstalovat
Firefox,
znovu
vše
instalovat
a
přihlásit,
ale
mám
zase
všude
ty
staré
položky
z
domácího
NTB.
Prosím,
jak
určit,
že
nechci
mít
se
starými
položkami
nic
společného,
že
je
chci
vymazat,
že
chci
primárně
používat
výhradně
a
jenom
data
ze
zařízení
-
pracovní
NTB?
Please
please
please

I
get
a

stating
that
Firefox
can't
run
a

then
the
spinning

Just
recently
I
get
a
message
'Warning:

(especially
when
going
to

like

I'm
then
given
the
choice
of

Debug

Stop

Continue.
None
of
these

seem
to

and
I
usually
end

thought
I
might
de-install

and
download
the

However,
when
I
click

I
tried
LXDE,
LXQT
and
Plasma5
desktop
on
the
same
machine.
The
bootup
time
of
firefox
seems
not
to
depend
on
the
desktop
installed
on
this
machine.
I
run
Version
54.0
of
firefox.
I
use
an
empty
startup
page.
There
are
no
add-ons
installed.
I
also
tried
firefox
in
save
mode.
I
deleted
the
browser
history.
Nothing
helped
to
speed
up
the
start
of
firefox.
Google
chrome-browser
starts
in
less
than
5
sec
on
the
same
computer
...
Is
there
a
way
to
speed
up
the
startup
process
of
firefox
on
this
machine?
How
can
I
detect
(with
javascript)
if
Firefox
is
blocking
Flash
for
a
specific
site?
I've
found
that
while
FireFox
(version
55)
blocks
Flash
from
loading,
it
still
reports
a
valid
flash
version
to
SWFobject,
it
still
passes
Modernizr's
Flash
blocker
test,
it
even
downloads
a
requested
SWF
before
failing
to
load
it.
For
other
browsers
phasing
in
Flash
restrictions
(Chrome,
Edge)
detecting
Flash
has
been
disabled
for
a
site
is
quite
easy
(the
version
is
reported
as
zero).
The
only
way
left
I
can
think
to
detect
this
is
quite
inelegant.
Attempt
to
load
a
SWF
that
communicates
to
JS
and
then
wait
to
see
if
that
communication
comes
or
not.
My
need
is
that
we
need
to
know
if
Flash
is
being
blocked
for
our
users
and
then
provide
them
with
more
explicit
instruction
as
to
what's
going
on
and
how
to
resolve
it
(for
online
training).
Is
there
a
simple
solution
I'm
failing
to
see?
Thanks,

Firefox
crashes
I
have
lost
the
ability
to
play
some
of
the
games
on

I
get
the
following

So
it

it's

Please
fix
it!
How
do
I
turn
OFF
permanently
the
Tout
Player
window?
Or
at
least
have
control
of
when
it's
active!
After
looking
at
a
video
embedded
in
an
article
I've
opened
from
my
E-mail,
and
then
attempting
to
read
more
text
below
the
video
window,
the
video
appears
in
the
lower
right
corner
of
my
display
screen
and
I
can
find
nothing
which
will
close
it.
There
is
a
small,
boxed,
right
inclined
arrow
in
the
upper
right
corner
of
the
video
which,
when
clicked
upon,
clears
the
image
in
the
lower
right
corner
of
my
display
screen
&
opens
a
conventional
appearing
window
in
the
middle
of
my
display
screen,
titled
'Tout
Player'
with
the
same
content
as
the
smaller
video
just
cleared.
When
I
click
the
'X'
in
the
Tout
Player
window,
that
window
does
close
as
expected.
However,
the
smaller
video
image
reappears
in
the
lower
right
corner
of
my
display
screen.
Either
window
blocks
part
of
the
main
article
text
which
I'm
trying
to
read.
The
content
of
the
Tout
Player
must
be
active
at
times
without
displaying
the
small
lower
right
corner
video
because
often
after
viewing
a
video
in
the
main
article,
I'll
hear
a
soundtrack
(about
some
other
video,
or
an
advertisement)
which
I
cannot
locate
its
source
and
cannot
turn
off.
What
are
the
Firefox
(or
possible
my
PC)
settings
which
control
this?
Thank
you
in
advance
for
any
enlightenment
you
can
provide.

Feature?
Question
#1):
My
firefox
used
to
be
54.0.1,
but
when
I
looked
at
the
update
schedule
today
(August
10th),
I
noticed
that
there
was
an
update
that
was
(supposedly)
released
two
days
ago,
on
August
8th.
Usually,
my
browser
updates
automatically,
or
tells
me
when
there
is
an
update
when
I
go
to
Help-About
Firefox.
Is
there
a
reason
that
the
update
did
not
show
up?
Was
the
update
delayed
for
some
reason,
and
if
so,
how
do
I
go
back
to
the
previous
version?
Question
#2:
As
you
may
have
gathered,
I
have
since
updated
to
55.0
version,
and
I
am
partially
tempted
to
go
back
to
my
previous
version
because
of
this
issue.
As
of
right
now,
the
bookmarks
sidebar
has
this
extra
bar/tab
on
it
(the
circled
bit
that
says
'Bookmarks').
Why
was
this
tab
added?
It
does
not
seem
to
be
needed,
and
disrupts
the
look
of
the
bookmarks
tab.
Is
there
a
way
to
get
rid
of
it?

I'd
rather

I've

but
nothing

Restore
a
previous
session
OK,
here's
what
I
want
to
do:
I
open
a
Firefox
session
then
open
a
few
different
sites
in
different
tabs.
Now,
I
want
to
save
this
set
of
tabs.
Not
as
my
home
page
but
just
as
something
I
want
to
restore
later.
Example:
This
is
about
real
estate.
So
I
want
to
open
a
listing,
then
a
map,
then
an
article
about
the
location,
etc.
I
then
want
to
save
all
this,
close
everything,
open
up
another
set
of
tabs
about
another
location
and
save
this
one.
Then
next
week,
I
want
to
reopen
the
complete
set
of
tabs
that
I
saved.
How
to
disable
the
empty
translucent
gray
sidebar
that
comes
in
from
the
left
side
of
Firefox
In
the
last
couple
of
days
(since
the
last
upgrade,
I
think)
whenever
I
mouse
over
to
the
left
side
of
Firefox,
a
large,
gray,
translucent
sidebar
appears,
covering
half
the
page.
It
has
an
X
in
the
upper
right
corner,
which
says
'close
sidebar'
when
I
mouse
over
it.
However,
it
does
not
respond
to
my
mouse
click.
I
can
get
rid
of
the
sidebar
by
mousing
to
the
far
right
of
my
screen.
But
it's
a
real
nuisance
that
every
time
my
mouse
strays
left,
that
thing
slides
in
from
the
left.

This

seems
to
have
started
when
I

from

and
updated

after

I

I
followed
the

haven't

found
any
steps
I'm
able
to

because
they
all

why
when
I

it
gives

three

How

Hi,
I
decided
to
move
back
from
Chrome
to
Firefox
a
few
days
ago.
Everything
works
great
except
pinch
to
zoom
on
the
touchscreen.
If
I
pinch
to
zoom
on
the
touchscreen,
Firefox
actually
adjusts
the

zoom
level
rather
than
just
magnifying
the
content
as
is.
Is
it
possible
to
get
the
standard
touchscreen
pinch
to
zoom
behavior
with
Firefox?
Thank
you.

Tabs
suddenly
started
crashing,
espcially
tabs
with
videos
or
pictures.
This
morning
(August
10th,
2017),
I
logged
on
to
my
computer
and
started
going
about
my
business.
I
found
that
suddenly,
mostly
on
tabs
with
videos
or
pictures,
I
would
get
the
'Gah,
this
tab
has
crashed!'
window.
It'll
happen
erratically
a
few
minutes
after
opening
the
tab,
and
is
getting
really
annoying.
I've
been
puzzled
by
this,
as
it
was
working
perfectly
fine
last
night.
I've
looked
for
solutions,
and
couldn't
really
find
anything.

is),

even
tried

out
how
to

does

from

firefox
fails
to
download
the

or

the

incorrectly.
Often
firefox
crashes
in
the
process.
It
works
with
chromium,
which
makes
me
believe
it
should
work
in
firefox,
my

as
well.
Are
there

GIFV
Corruption
and
Display
Driver
Crash
on
FF
55+
Hoping
someone
has
a
solution
for
me
here
as
I'm
out
of
ideas.
Since
upgrading
to
55.0.1
I
noticed
that
some
.gif
files
would
show
corrupted
output
on
playback.
When
I
dug
into
it
I
found
that
it
was
only
.gifv
files
causing
this
to
happen.
Additionally
I
found
that
if
I
view
multiple
.gifv
files
at
once
my
display
driver
will
crash
and
reset.
Also,
viewing
a
.gifv
file
concurrently
with
a
YouTube
video
results
in
display
artifacts
on
the
video.
First
thing
I
tried
was
disabling
hardware
acceleration,
which
resolved
the
problem,
but
this
introduces
some
ugly
screen
tearing
when
scrolling.
I
then
refreshed
Firefox,
created
a
new
profile,
and
then
finally
blew
the
whole
install
away
to
make
sure
that
there
wasn't
some
about:config
setting
responsible.
Tested
at
each
step
and
verified
the
same
behavior.
Bumped
the
install
to
the
beta
branch
-
same
behavior.
Rolled
everything
back
to
54.0.1
and
the
problem
is
fixed
(no
corruption
with
hardware
acceleration
enabled).
Normally
between
disabling
hardware
acceleration
and
dumping
my
FF
profile/install
I
would
have
tried
a
driver
update.
Unfortunately
this
laptop
rocks
an
Intel
HD
3000
which
is
no
longer
supported
and
thus
has
no
driver
update
available.
My
choices
seem
to
be
-
stick
with
54.0.1,
use
55.0.1
w/out
h/w
acceleration,
or
use
the
ESR
branch.
The
ESR
branch
doesn't
have
the
problem
but
is
much
slower
than
the
latest
branches,
so
that's
not
ideal.
The
whole
thing
seems
tied
to
some
change
in
the
way
that
h/w
acceleration
works
between
55.0.1
and
older
versions
of
Firefox.
Is
there
some
about:config
setting
I
can
use
to
make
55.0.1
h/w
acceleration
work
like
it
did
in
54.0.1?
Example
file
that
exhibits
the
issue:
http://i.imgur.com/64X8JOt.gifv
And
here's
what
it
looks
like
in
55.0.1+
with
h/w
acceleration
enabled:

both
32-bit
&
64-bit
versions
on
my
64-bit
OS/PC.
How
do
I
safely
remove
64-bit?
Hello,
Although
I
am
running
Windows
10
Home
Edition
(64-bit),
I've
always
continued
to
use
the
32-bit
version
of
Firefox
because
I
have
read
that
some
add-ons
don't
function
properly
when
running
on
the
64-bit
version
(among
other
things).
I
recently
joined
Mozilla's
Email
Newsletter
and
just
a
few
hours
ago
I
received
an
Email
announcing
the
release
of
Firefox
55.
I
opened
the
Email
and
clicked
on
the
link/button
that
took
me
to
a
page
detailing
the
new
fixes/updates
in
this
latest
version.
Well,
while
I
was
on
this
'Changelog'
page
(so
to
speak),
I
received
a
notification
informing
me
that
I
was
using
an
outdated
version
of
Firefox
and
that
I
should
'Click
Here'
(or
'Download
Now')
to
get
the
latest
version,
security
updates,
etc.
and
that's
exactly
what
I
did.
Of
course,
I
had
no
idea
(or
didn't
even
consider)
that
because
I'm
running
a
64-bit
system,
Firefox
automatically
downloaded
the
64-bit
installer
which
was
simply
named
'Firefox
Installer.exe'
which
consequently
gave
me
no
indication
that
anything
was
amiss.
I
proceeded
to
launch
the
installer
and
although
I
found
it
odd
that
it
didn't
ask
me
which
directory
I
wanted
the
installation
to
reside
in,
the
installation
process
went
quickly
and
very
smoothly.
I'm
pretty
sure
while
it
was
installing
there
was
still
no
indication
that
the
64-bit
version
was
the
one
actually
being
installed.
However,
as
I
said,
it
went
so
quickly
and
smoothly
that
I
may
have
missed
any
mention
of
it
being
the
64-bit
version
but
once
again,
I
highly
doubt
there
was
any
mention
of
it
and
at
this
point
it
really
doesn't
matter
as
it's
irrelevant.
So
after
the
installation
was
complete,
I
noticed
a
duplicate
Firefox
shortcut
on
my
Desktop
and
this
is
when
I
knew
something
had
gone
wrong.
As
you
may
have
guessed,
I
quickly
realized
that
the
new
(duplicate)
Desktop
shortcut
was
pointing
toward
'firefox.exe'
in
my
'Program
Files'
folder
instead
of
where
it
should
have
been
pointing
to
(my
'Program
Files
(x86)'
folder).
I
did
go
ahead
and
launch
the
64-bit
version
and
although
I
was
pleased
to
see
that
my
previous
session
along
with
all
of
my
tabs
and
add-ons
had
been
transferred
from
the
32-bit
version
to
my
default
64-bit
Firefox
profile,
it
didn't
take
long
for
me
to
realize
two
of
my
add-ons
were
not
displaying
and/or
functioning
properly.
Without
doing
anything
except
glancing
down
at
my
status
bar
(which
is
usually
properly
present/displayed
in
the
32-bit
version
due
to
an
add-on
I
have
installed)
and
clicking
the
'Open
menu'
button
(the
one
with
the
three
horizontal
lines
stacked
on
top
of
each
other)
in
the
top-right
corner,
I
quickly
noticed
that
not
only
one,
but
two
of
my
add-ons
were
not
displaying
and/or
functioning
properly.
This
let
me
know
right
away
that
what
I've
read
was
correct:
some
add-ons
don't
display
and/or
function
properly
in
the
64-bit
version.
Instantly,
this
was
enough
for
me
to
exit
out
of
the
64-bit
version
without
even
opening
my
Add-ons
manager
and/or
caring
to
investigate
any
further.
With
that
said,
my
mind
immediately
focused
on
uninstalling
the
64-bit
version.
Now,
the
only
reason
I
didn't
immediately
proceed
with
the
uninstallation
is
because
although
I
don't
think
uninstalling
the
64-bit
version
will
mess
up
and/or
do
any
harm
to
the
32-bit
version,
there
is
no
way
I
can
be
sure
and
I
decided
it
was
best
to
ask
the
experts.
I
will
say
that
before
coming
here
to
post
a
question
concerning
this
matter,
I
performed
several
quick
(but
efficient)
Google
searches
and
I
could
not
find
anyone
who
has
previously
ran
into
this
problem
(although
I'm
sure
it's
happened
before).
I
don't
believe
the
problem
was
within
the
Google
queries
I
performed,
but
more
so
the
fact
that
Google's
Search
Engine
Results
Pages
(SERPs)
were
overcrowded
with
people
asking
(or
articles
detailing)
which
version
was
better,
how
to
migrate,
if
one
should
migrate,
and
all
that
good
stuff.
Furthermore,
I
looked
through
the
Mozilla
Support/Knowledge
Base
before
ultimately
deciding
it
was
reasonable
(in
my
opinion
at
least)
to
post
a
question
describing
my
current
situation.
I
did
go
to
'Add
or
Remove
Programs'
and
when
I
scrolled
down
to
where
Firefox
is
located
in
the
list
of
all
of
the
programs
I
have
installed,
you
will
see
what
I
saw
in
the
image
I
have
attached
to
this
post.
The
reason
I
included
Thunderbird
in
the
screenshot
is
because
I'm
unsure
of
whether
'Mozilla
Maintenance
Service'
is
related
to
Firefox
32-bit
and/or
64-bit,
or
whether
it's
only
related
to
Thunderbird.
I'm
guessing
it's
either
only
related
to
both
versions
of
the
Firefox
browser
that
I
now
have
installed,
or
only
related
to
Firefox
64-bit.
For
all
I
know
it
could
be
related
to
all
three
Mozilla
products
I
have
installed
at
the
moment
but
the
reason
I
suspect
it's
related
(at
least
in
part,
if
not
fully)
to
the
64-bit
version
is
because
the
date
displayed
next
to
the
'Mozilla
Maintenance
Service'
is
the
same
as
the
date
displayed
next
to
the
64-bit
version
of
Firefox
which
of
course
is
today's
date
(August
11,
2017)
because
this
whole
unfortunate
situation
occurred
this
morning.
I'm
not
sure
whether
these
dates
solely
represent
fresh
installations
or
both
fresh
installations
and
modifications.
So
of
course,
I'm
wondering
what
I
should
do.
What
do
you
recommend?
I
think
I've
already
made
it
perfectly
clear
that
this
was
a
total
misadventure
and
I
would
like
to
completely
remove
the
64-bit
version
without
messing
up
and/or
harming
the
32-bit
version.
How
do
I
go
about
doing
this
safely?
Do
I
simply
uninstall
only
the
64-bit
version
from
'Add
or
Remove
Programs'
or
is
there
more
to
it
than
that?
What
about
the
'Mozilla
Maintenance
Service'
installation?
Should
I
worry
about
it
or
simply
leave
it
as-is?
Any
and
all
suggestions
are
not
only
welcome,
but
each
and
every
one
will
be
greatly
appreciated.
Furthermore,
if
any
additional
information
is
required
from
me
on
my
end,
please
don't
hesitate
to
ask
and
I
will
respond
with
whatever
it
is
that
you
may
need
ASAP.
In
closing,
I
do
apologize
for
the
very-detailed
and
fairly
long
post.
However,
I
do
appreciate
each
and
every
one
of
you
who
have
continued
to
read
this
far
and
I
would
like
to
include
that
I
was
purposely
as
detailed
and
long-winded
as
possible
because
it
is
suggested
that
the
person
asking
the
question
or
presenting
the
issue
include
as
many
details
as
possible
when
typing
up
a
post
in
order
to
help
out
the
experts
who
will
be
troubleshooting
and/or
solving
the
issue/question
at
hand.
Thank
you
very
much
(in
advance)
to
all
of
you
who
have
spent
your
time
reading
all
about
my
current
situation
(whether
you
are
able
to
offer
any
support
or
not).
I
will
be
eagerly
awaiting
and
looking
forward
to
any
and
all
replies/suggestions.
P.S.
I
will
be
quite
busy
for
the
remainder
of
today,
however
I
will
check
this
post
as
frequently
as
possible.
In
fact,
I
might
be
able
to
check
it
every
time
there
is
a
reply.
That
remains
to
be
seen,
but
nevertheless,
I'll
be
around
to
respond
to
any
and
all
replies
in
a
fairly
prompt
manner
(as
quickly
as
I'm
able
to
do
so).
<b><u>EDIT:</u></b>
I
just
noticed
that
all
of
my
Bookmarks'
Favicons
have
been
erased
and
replaced
with
the
default
gray
globe/World
Wide
Web
icon.
Although
this
is
kind
of
frustrating,
it
isn't
a
huge
deal.
However,
it
has
me
wondering
what
else
may
have
been
affected
by
having
both
the
32-bit
and
64-bit
versions
installed.
I

Is

Certain

the

winds
up
being
redundant/distracting.
Is
it
possible

:
Hello
LoriLPike,
Thanks
for
contacting
support,
LoriLPike.
I
understand
how
that
issue
can
be
very
frustrating.
Users
with
the
latest
FireFox
and
Flash
combination
are
reporting
this
issue
to
us.
Some
have
reported
it
happening
with
all
flash
sites,
in
fact.
Our
recommendation
is
to
try
another
browser,
such
as
Chrome,
Comodo
Icedragon
(my
favorite),
or
Opera.
As
we
cannot
resolve
issue
with
FireFox
and
Adobe,
and
this
isn't
the
first
time
that
combination
has
caused
issues,
we
will
be
unable
to
do
much
with
the
game
to
address
the
issues.
Last
time,
adobe
released
a
new
flash
update
a
few
days
later,
and
that
seemed
to
work.
Currently,
that
combination
still
works
ok
for
FF
users.
FireFox
version
54
with
flash
26.0.0.131.
While
we
do
not
condone
using
older
software,
that
may
be
an
acceptable
work-around
until
the
issue
gets
worked
out
between
FireFox
and
Adobe.
Thanks
and
have
a
nice
day.

How
to
remove
the
New
Tab
button?
Hello.
I
try
to
remove
as
many
unnecessary
butoons,
but
I
cannot
remove
one
of
them.
___It
is
called
New
Tab.
I
have
tried
going
to
Customize,
but
it
does
not
help
-
whenever
I
try
to
drag
the
button/icon
away,
it
opens
a
new
tab.
Please,
help
me
remove
this
button/icon.
It
simply
eats
up
the
useful
space
on
the
screen,
and
i
do
not
find
it
useful
as
there
is
a
similar
button
called
'Open
a
New
Tab'.
So,
I
do
not
need
TWO
buttons
which
do
THE
SAME
thing.
How
do
I
remove
the
New
Tab
button?
The
screenshot
shows
this
button.
Look
at
the
screenshot,
please.

De

tenho
percebido
que
o

Já

Mas
uma
coisa
que
percebi
no

Why

Hello,
I
spend
a
lot
of
time
on
GaiaOnline
as
well
as
using
my
email
on
firefox.
Lately,
any
time
I
try
to
submit
posts
or
send
emails,
firefox
is
changing
all
of
my
quotation
marks,
apostrophes,
and
misc.
bbcode
characters
into
other,
random
characters.
For
instance,
quotation
marks
all
become
â€,
and
apostrophes
all
become
â€™.
This
is
very
frustrating
and
has
made
firefox
impossible
for
me
to
use.
I
have
really
tested
if
I
have
the
issue
on
other
sites,
and
at
the
moment
I'm
stuck
using
Chrome
since
there
is
simply
no
work
around
for
me
to
write
normally.
I
thought
the
newest
update
would
fix
this,
but
no
luck,
and
I've
already
completely
refreshed
firefox
to
defaults
to
try
and
fix
this...
I'm
already
really
sad
I
had
to
do
all
of
that
and
I
just
want
to
be
able
to
use
firefox
again...
I'm
tired
of
Chrome
or
I
wouldn't
be
writing...

Previously
(yesterday)
when
I
selected
a

at
the
top
of
the

it
displayed
a

of

I
had
been
on
and
all
I
did
was
click
on
one,
and

would
take
me
there.
Now
when
I
select
a

I
get

How
do
I

the

is
that

Is
it

I

why
does

Can

Can
I

One
is
all
I

However,
it

gotten
large
enough
to

off

line,
and
into

down.
Again,
not
looking
to
add
a
different

but
is
there
a
way
to
wrap
it
around
horizontally,
so
that
I
may
see
2,

even
3
lines
worth?

Can't
Upload
Thumbnails
to
YouTube
Videos
Hi
folks,
since
updating
to
the
latest
version
Firefox
55,
a
couple
of
days
ago,
I've
been
having
issues
uploading
thumbnail
images
to
my
YouTube
videos.
I've
never
had
this
issue
before.
Initially,
I
thought
this
had
to
be
a
YouTube
platform
issue
(and
maybe
it
is
partly),
but
when
I
logged
into
my
YouTube
account
using
Google
Chrome,
I
had
no
issue
uploading
the
same
thumbnail
image
to
my
YouTube
video.
I've
reported
this
issue
to
YouTube
and
Mozilla,
however,
I
thought
I'd
post
this
issue
here
in
the
hopes
of
identifying
the
issue.
Generally,
once
I
upload
my
video
to
YouTube,
it
automatically
generates
three
thumbnails.
However,
I
never
use
any
of
the
three
and
instead
upload
my
own.
I've
never
had
an
issue
uploading
a
thumbnail
before.
So
basically
when
I
try
to
upload
the
PNG
image
(which
meets
the
requirements
of
YouTube),
it
just
spins
the
loading
wheel
and
does
not
upload
the
image
(see
attached
screenshot).
So
I
tried
logging
into
my
YouTube
account
via
Google
Chrome
and
I
was
able
to
upload
the
exact
same
thumbnail
without
any
issues.
I
would
appreciate
if

Why
is
Mozilla
waging
a
war
on
the
public,
i.e.
initiating
a
campaign
to
start
a
'thought
police'
to
combat
fake
news?
http://www.businessinsider.com/mozilla-new-initiative-counter-fake-news-2017-8
Why
is
Mozilla
destroying
their
own
product
with
these
suicidal
business
practices?
Do
they
hate
their
own
customers?
Or
do
they
just
hate
the
first
amendment?
I
recently
lost
my
browsing
history
and
was
wondering
if
there
was
a
way
to
restore
it
My
computer
restarted
yesterday
and
when
I
got
onto
firefox
All
of
my
browsing
history
was
gone.
including
my
frequent
sites.

So
Soros
teamed
up
with
Firefox
according
to
an
article
on
activistpost.com
to
implement
a
'fact-check'
engine
or
whatever.
Is
this
is
true?

The
idea
that
the

changed
in
any

unsettles
me
as
I
work
as
an
journalist
I
need
all
the

to
work
with,
not
just
a
spoon-fed
version
of

And
if

would
that

have

for
WaterFox
and
other
FireFox
based
derivates?
Thx
in

Firefox
fails
to
open
-
'mozgloe.dll
was
not
found'
While
still
using
XP
SP3,
I've
been
using
Firefox
as
my
default
browser
for
several
years.
A
few
days
ago
it
was
still
working
fine
and
then
later
the
same
day,
when
attempting
to
go
online,
this
message
appeared:
'firefox.exe
-
Application
Error
'The
application
failed
to

0xc0000022.
Click
on
OK
to

After
much
searching
on
the
Internet
(using
Opera),
I
un-installed
Firefox,
downloaded
Firefox
Setup
52.3.0esr.exe
and
re-installed
it
and
refreshed
it.
At
the
finish,
Firefox
opened
and
seemed
to
function
properly.
After
rebooting,
Firefox
again
failed
to
open
and
this
same
above
error
message
was
displayed.
I
scanned
with
AVG.
The
result
was
as
follows:

I
rebooted
which
allowed
AVG
to
remove
these
files.
I
then
un-installed
Firefox
a
second
time
and
attempted
to
use
Firefox
Setup
52.3.0esr.exe
again
to
re-install
it.
An
AVG

appeared
indicating
several
more

all
requiring
a
reboot
to
remove.
I
downloaded
a
fresh
Firefox
Setup
52.3.0esr.exe,
and
attempted
to
re-install
Firefox.
At
the
finish,
the
following
message
appeared:
'firefox.exe

problem.'
Additional
scans
have
turned
up
no
new
viruses.
I
have
un-installed
Firefox
for
the
third
time
and
will
have
to
use
Opera
as
my
browser
until
this
issue
is
resolved.
How

What

I
suspect

How

it

I

I

Firefox
shuts
down
by
itself
Hi,
Since
a
week
or
so
my
firefox
browser
shuts
down
without
any
error
or
crashmessage.
when
I
browse
on
the
net
it
suddenly
decides
to
shut
down
on
any
given
moment.
I've
already
reinstalled
firefox
but
the
problem
stays
the
same.
I've
noticed
that
in
the
add-ons
there
is
something
I
did
not
instal
called:
chill-tab.
Can
this
be
the
problem?
I'm
running
firefox
54.0.1
(64-bit)
on
a
Macbook
pro
sierra
10.12.4
Does
anyone
have
an
idea
about
how
to
fix
this?
How
can
I
see
the
add-on
wallpaper
behind
the
Firefox
home
page?
I
found
and
added
wallpaper
and
I
can
see
it
behind
the
Firefox
homepage
(up
at
the
top)
but
I
cannot
find
a
way
to
see
it
full
screen.
When
I
close
Firefox
it
disappears.
Stop
playing
video
opened
in
a
new
tab
until
switch
to
it.
Hi
there!
I
struggle
with
some
irritating
problem.
I
often
open
many
tabs
e.g.
when
I
search
something
on
YouTube
or
something.
The
problem
is
that
they
start
playing
video
immediately
even
though
I
don't
want
to
yet.
There
is
one
browser
which
do
the
job
by
default
but
I
don't
want
to
use
it.
Let
me
honestly
say:
I
want
to
use
Firefox!
:)
Setting
up
media.autoplay.enabled
to
false
completely
destroys
video
playing.
An
add-on
called
flash-controll
is
equally
useful
as
previous
tip.
Any
idea?
Every
time
I
log
into
Airbnb
from
Firefox
it
remembers
the
password
but
then
I'm
asked
by
Airbnb
to
authenticate
with
an
extra
security
password.
Why?
Airbnb
requires
an
extra
level
of
security
for
logging
in,
like
increasing
numbers
of
sites.
If
you
log
in
from
a
new
mobile,
laptop,
iPad
or
whatever,
it
requires
entering
an
extra
four
digit
code
to
authenticate.
I
thought
this
should
only
be
when
you
log
in
from
a
new
device
but
this
step
is
also
required
from
my
desktop
each
time.
Firefox
remembers
my
password
for
Airbnb
but
when
I
hit
enter
to
log
in,
Airbnb
comes
back
with
the
second
step.
When
I'm
at
home
that's
okay
-
just
annoying
-
and
I
can
receive
an
email
or
a
phone
call
or
text
message
but
when
I'm
travelling
and
don't
have
another
device
with
me
or
a
suitable
local
phone
number
registered
(for
more
than
two
weeks)
with
Airbnb,
I'm
locked
out.
Is
this
because
I've
not
got
some
cookie
cache
enabled
with
Firefox
on
my
desktop
or
is
this
Airbnb's
problem?

I
cannot

certain
websites
on

and
every
solution
I've
found
has
not

Only
today
have
I
had
this
problem...I
have
tried
everything,
but
nothing
I
am
able
to
do
seems
to
be
able
to
fix
my
inability
to
reach
several
websites
that
I
know
are
secure
and
that
I've
been
to
several
times.
Here
are
two
examples
of
sites
giving
me
error
messages
(the
second
one
being
ironic):
https://www.northfielddrivein.com/
https://www.isitdownrightnow.com/
In
addition,
some
websites
won't
even
load
for
me,
like
wiki
pages.
And
some
sites
don't
display
properly.
i
feel
like
Firefox
might
b
messed
up,
but
I
hope
I'm
wrong.
Every
time
I
go
to
those
sites
(which
I
have
never
had
problems
with),
I
get
the
usual
'Unable
to
connect'
message.
And
those
aren't
the
only
sites
doing
this.
There's
several
others
I
can't
access
anymore
either.
And
when
I
tried
accessing
them
in
Google
Chrome
or
on
my
iPad,
i
was
able
to
just
fine.
The
problem's
only
in
Firefox.
Oh,
and
to
be
specific,
the
version
of
Windows
I
use
is
Windows
7.
I
have
literally
tried
every
solution
listed
on
these
pages:
https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/websites-dont-load-troubleshoot-and-fix-errors
https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-cant-load-websites-other-browsers-can
I
have
also
restarted
my
computer
several
times,
tried
installing
the
latest
version
of
Firefox,
unplugged
my
router
for
ten
seconds
and
plugged
it
back
in,
and
I
have
that
use
proxy
setting
or
whatever
box
unchecked
and
everything.

everything
in
these
guides
and

chrome
over

Does
anyone
know
how

How
do
I
cast

chromecast
from
Firefox
A
desktop
PC
running
Win10
The
dropdown
menu
of
sites
is
too
short
all
of
a
sudden,
only
five.
Firefox
suddenly
shortened
the
list
of
sites
I
visit
often.
I
can
shorten
it
further,
but
cannot
expand
it.
This
is
extremely
annoying
and
may
make
me
choose
to
leave
Mozilla
Firefox.
In
the
past,
sites
would
get
dropped,
but
I
always
had
plenty
of
room
to
delete
and
re-add.
Is
there
some
fix?
When
I
try
to
close
one
tab,
the
next
one
closes
as
well.
So,
awhile
ago
(without
changing
something
or
installing
a
new
addon)
upon
using
the
Firegestures
addon
to
close
one
tab
(right
click
+
moving
the
mouse
left),
after
having
the
current
tab
closing,
sometimes
the
next
one
closes
as
well.
It
is
like
the
command
to
close
a
tab
is
registered
twice.
Furthermore,
the
'opening
new
tab'
(right
click
+
moving
the
mouse
left)
firegesture
also
opens
two
tabs
sometimes
(rarely).
I
haven't
changed
the
firegesture
codes
and
I
don't
think
any
other
addon
has
to
do
anything
with
it
since
the
problem
occurs
on
a
new,
test
profile
as
well.
I
am
not
sure
it's
an
issue
regarding
Firegestures
only,
since
I've
also
noticed
that
the
context
menu
popup
(appearing
with
the
right
click)
started
getting
more
'immediate
/
dominant'
per
se.
By
that
I
mean
that
OFTEN,
when
I'd
keep
the
right
click
pressed
down
and
move
the
wheel
in
order
to
scroll
through
the
opened
tabs,
I'd
get
the
context
menu
opening
up
instead
of
getting
the
tab
scrolling
effect.
That
started
happening
along
with
the
double
tab
closing/opening.
Nothing
came
up
upon
searching,
the
only
thing
I've
found
that
may
or
may
not
have
to
do
with
my
issue
is
this:
https://forums.asp.net/t/1056418.aspx?Button+click+event+handler+firing+twice
That
could
be
a
totally
different
thing
of
course,
and
it
is
certainly
not
helping
much.
Any
ideas?
Thanks
a
lot.
Firefox
not
responding
Since
my
PC
ran
a
Windows
update
mid
week
I'm
having
trouble
using
Firefox.
Initially
it
just
started
cutting
out
or
not
responding
occasionally
but
now
Firefox
is
basically
working
for
5
mins
after
starting
the
computer
and
then
stops
(not
responding;
not
reacting
to
clicks;
not
opening
bookmarks
etc.).
The
interesting
thing
is
this
-
while
I
was
still
able
to
use
Chrome
instead
yesterday,
Chrome
is
now
doing
exactly
the
same
(i.e.
not
responding)
which
is
why
I
switched
to
Opera
which
works
so
far.
I've
tried
to
reset
the
computer
to
prior
the
update
but
failed
three
times
getting
an
error
message
basically
saying
'system
restore
did
not
complete
successfully.
I'm
not
a
computer
expert
and
actually
only
bought
the
computer
a
year
ago.
I
also
have
an
up-to
date
virus
software
(Bitdefender).
Can
anyone
suggest
what
to
do?
Appreciate
the
help!
favicons
wrong
in
bookmarks
and
history
After
last
FF55
update
few
favicons
didn't
appear
right
way
in
history
and
bookmarks
while
being
right
on
tab
and
address
bar.
This
has
happened
few
times
before
and
refreshing
the
page
returns
the
right
favicon,
but
not
this
time.
This
is
permanent
as
far
as
I
can
see.
However,
most
of
the
pages
didn't
change
and
new
pages
opened/held
right
favicons.
Today
things
went
even
weirder
as
all
first
time
opened
pages
started
showing
the
wrong
favicon
and
when
clicking
the
old/saved
ones
they
all
turned
to
the
wrong
favicons.
Any
ideas
what
is
the
cause
and
how
to
fix
it?

things
have
happened
with
several
other
sites,
but
I
can't
remember
all
the
ones
it
happened
with.
Is
this
possibly
an
issue
with
my
settings,
or
a
problem
with
the
browser?

Pocket

on

not

I
have

since
a
few
years
and
I
want
to

with

my

I
discovered
that
the

is
not
working.
I
can
click
on
it
and
log
in
with
my
account
(same
email
as
I
use

Then
I'm
logged

and
my

shown.
When
I
now
click
on
the
Pocket
button
again
to
safe
an

it
only
offers
me
to
log
in.
The
same
happens
when
I
right-click
on

and
choose

It
looks
like

doesn't
recognize
that
I'm
logged

Here
some
additional
information:

that

works

could
be

It's
almost
impossible
to
ask
a
direct
question
of

at
(almost?)
any
website
service.
That
is
a
shame....
I
just
updated
to
FF55.
My

reload
are
still
there,
and
usable,

are
invisible.

are
gone.

'Taken

page
I
was
using
up-to-date
Firefox
on
up-to-date
Windows
10
PC,
with
up-to-date
Norton
security,
on
a
BT
broadband
landline.
The
computer
was
idle,
and
displaying
an
eBay
auction
list.
Suddenly,
with
no
keyboard
or
mouse
action,
the
screen
changed
itself
to
a
page
(screenshot
available
as
a
JPG)
which
I
suspect
was
a
phishing
attempt
from
elsewhere.
Is
this
a
fault
in
Firefox
(Adobe

disabled)
or
Windows
10,
or
eBay,
or
even
a
failure
by
Norton
?

Como
proceder?
Porque
os

no

Após
ultima
atualização
do

não
consigo
mais
utilizar
os
adesivos
(similar
a
emoticons)
na
rede
social
VK.
porque
as
miniaturas
na

não
carregam
para
eu
escolher,
então
tenho
que
clicar
as
cegas
sem
saber
qual

E
como
a

é

acaba
impedindo
o

dos
mesmos.
Sem
contar
que

comprei

Então
agora
ou
uso
o

pelo

ou
uma
versão

do

porque
a
atual
não
carrega
meus

Enfim,

no

use
the
Pinterest
'Pin
it'
function
from
any
website.
How
can
I
fix
this
please?
Hi
there
:)
I
have
done
extensive
troubleshooting
for
this
issue
but
nothing
Mozilla
has
suggested
has
worked.
I
have
followed
every
troubleshooting
step
from
your
support
pages
including
refreshing
firefox,
reinstalling
firefox,
removing
(deleting)
all
preferences
and
addons,
and
testing
in
safemode.
The
same
problem
exists
no
matter
where
I
try
to
use
the
'pin
it'
function
so
this
is
not
a
problem
occurring
with
one
specific
website.
At
first
I
thought
it
may
have
been
an
issue
with
the
Pinterest
browser
app
but
that
doesn't
seem
to
be
the
case
(as
I
did
test
that
first).
1.
When
I
try
to
pin
an
image
from
a
website,
another
tab
should
pop
up
showing
the
image
and
the
pinterest
board
settings.
This
no
longer
happens.
The
tab
still
pops
up
but
it
is
now
a
black
tab
with
no
text
and
no
pinterest
settings.
I
even
tried
reinstalling
java
because
I
thought
it
may
have
been
an
issue
with
Java
as
the
extension
ends
in
.js.
But
nope,
that
didn't
work
either.
2.
I
read
in
another
post
that
using
the
browser
console
for
output
when
trying
to
perform
the
'pin'
it
function
might
help
so
I
have
added
that
data
below.
It
wouldn't
let
me
attach
as
a
notepad
document.
Please
let
me
know
if
you
need
further
information.
Thanks

Two
deleted
tabs
continually
reload
when
Firefox
is
started.
Following
a
reset
of
my
virus
infected
PC,
two
unwanted
and
previously
deleted
tabs
reload
automatically
whenever
Firefox
is
started.
I've
tried
clearing
cookies
and
history
and
even
uninstalling
and
reinstalling
Firefox
but
the
tabs
keep
reloading,
I'm
guessing
from
some
hidden
still-infected
Firefox
file
that
also
restores
my
bookmarks
and
logins.
How
do
I
find
and
delete
that
file
or
otherwise
how
can
I
get
a
clean
virgin
installation
of
Firefox?
How
do
I
make
Firefox
the
default
jpg
viewer
in
Windows
10?
On
previous
versions
of
windows
I
set
firefox
as
the
default
application
for
viewing
pictures
(jpg,
png,
etc).
Windows
10
does
not
allow
me
to
do
this.
It
will
only
set
firefox
as
the
default
for
html
and
other
web
pages.
I
would
like
to
be
able
to
click
on
a
jpg
file
in
windows
and
have
it
open
in
firefox.

Why
does
mozilla
not
fix
their

problem?
Mozilla
leadership
appears
not
to
be
able
to
solve
what
is
a
recurring
problem
that
other
browsers
do
not
have.
Firefox
periodically
loses
the
ability
to
play
sound
from
the
internet.
It
appears
that
the
only
solution
may
be
to
give
up
on
Firefox
and
switch
to
a
more
reliable
browser.

pls
help
inaccurate
content
security
policy
I
believe
that
Firefox
is
inaccurately
blocking
a
resource,
however
it's
likely
that
I'm
just
mis-understanding
how
it
should
be
set
up.
I
see
that
there
is
this
open
bug:
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1242016
that
would
likely
have
helped
me.
The
issue:
It
looks
to
me
that
my
Content
Security
Policy
header
settings
here
are
correct:
https://thekyel.com/
Yet
I
get
the
message:
'Content
Security
Policy:
The
page’s
settings
blocked
the
loading
of
a
resource
at
http://thekyel.com/basic.css
(“style-src
https://thekyel.com
https://thekyel.com”).
(unknown)'
I
do
realize
that
it's
more
likely
that
my
headers
are
indeed
incorrect,
but
without
better
logging,
I
know
of
no
other
way
to
diagnose
the
issue.
Let
me
know
if
I
am
mistaken,
or
where
I
can
investigate
more
(I
have
disabled
all
addons)
New
update
missing
the
HTML
preview
option
in
the

For
a
dev,
this
is
a
huge
issue,
as
any
report
with
a
stack
trace
has
to
be
copied
and
pasted.
I
realize
this
is
a
bug
with
the
latest
build,
but
I
can't
see
any
report
of
progress.
I
honestly
chose
Firefox
over
Chrome
to
do
dev
work
on
web
apps
b/c
it
was
so
much
faster
to
get
bug
info
from
stack
traces
on
rendered
pages
like
those
from
Laravel,
Whoops,
etc.
Please
let
me
know
(or
at
least
please
add
me
to
the
group
hoping
this
is
fixed)
on
a
resolution.
Until
then,
I
have
downgraded
to
54
--
first
time
I've
ever
downgraded
Firefox
-
been
with
you
since
the
beginning.
And,
thank
you
for
a
great
product.

How
to
Manage
website
data
in
Firefox?
Please
tell
about
web
data
in
firefox
browser
that
how
can
i
manage
web
data
in
firefox
browser
.
Where
is
the
data
for
the
newtab
tiles
stored?
Can
I
stop
such
data
being
stored?
I
refer
to
the
discussion
at:
https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/973320.
The
result
of
the
discussion
is
that
by
adding
2
new
boolean
preferences
to
the
about:config
page,
and
then
deleting
the
contents
of
the
thumbnails
folder
in
the
profile,
I
am
referring
to:
browser.pagethumbnails.capturing_disabled
(true)
and
to
pageThumbs.enabled
(false).
By
creating
those
boolean
preferences,
it
is
possible
to
stop
Firefox
from
showing
tiles
of
previously
visited
pages
in
the
new
tab
page,
but
having
done
that
the
new
tab
page
still
shows
captions
of
previously
visited
pages
-
the
images
have
gone
but
the
web
addresses
are
still
shown.
This
is
reported
in
the
discussion
at
the
address
noted
above.
It
is
not
clear
whether
Firefox
will
continue
to
record
the
data
in
the
captions
as
new
pages
are
visited,
but
even
though
the
thumbnails
folder
has
been
cleaned,
the
data
in
the
captions
is
still
stored
somewhere.
It
amazes
me
that
having
provided
for
cleaning
of
history
etc
for
the
sake
of
security,
Firefox
has
been
designed
to
make
a
record
of
the
history
of
visited
pages,
and
that
there
is
no
obvious
way
to
delete
it
or
perhaps
even
prevent
further
such
data
being
stored.
Of
course,
you
can
customise
the
new
tab
page
not
to
show
the
captions,
but
you
can
easily
reverse
that
customisation,
upon
doing
which
it
is
apparent
that
the
data
is
still
there.
Firstly,
how
can
I
stop
further
captions
being
recorded
and
stored,
or
do
the
new
boolean
preferences
on
th
about
config
page
achieve
that?
Secondly,
where
is
the
captions
data
stored
in
Firefox,
and
how
may
it
be
deleted?
If
I
could
not
stop
it
from
being
collected
and
stored,
I
could
perhaps
set
up
a
custom
deletion
in
privacy
software
periodically
to
delete
the
records.
I
am
aware
that
the
tiles
can
be
deleted
individually,
but
there
appears
to
be
an
endless
supply
of
them,
and
so
I
need
to
delete
them
all
together,
and
also
automate
the
process
of
deleting
furhter
captions
if
I
cannot
stop
Firefox
from
storing
this
data.
After
updating
to
55.0,
all
menus
and
dropdowns
are
extremely
slow.
Went
back
to
54
and
they
worked.
Firefox
automatically
updated
to
55
and
problem
returned.
The
OS
is
Windows
7
64
bit.
All
right
click
dropdowns
and
toolbar
dropdowns
are
affected.
Most
of
the
time,
I
get
only
an
outline.
A
'refresh'
deleted
all
my
extensions
and
favicons
but
did
not
fix
the
problem.
Only
manually
going
back
to
54
seemed
to
work
but
as
soon
as
it
updated
to
55
the
problem
returned.
Firefox
window
switches
from

My
firefox
broswer/window
will
switch
from
my
primary
window
to
the
background
on
its
own
at
random
times.
The
close,
minimize
and
enlarge
buttons
all
turn
from
colored
to
grey,
like
if
I
click
on
a
different
window
of
a
different
application.
This
even
happens
while
I'm
typing
which
stops
allowing
me
to
type
and
I'll
get
the
'error'
bell
sound.
I
won't
be
able
to
continue
typing
till
I
click
on
the
window
again.
This
doesn't
happen
with
other
browsers
or
applications.
It
doesn't
happen
on
every
website
I
use.

After
reboot,
tabs
are
blank,
pages
won't
load,
Firefox
won't
close.
I've
switched
to
Windows
10
recently,
and
I've
been
struggling
with
a
very
weird
bug
in
all
versions
of
Firefox:
Sometimes,
when
I
open
Firefox
after
a
reboot,
all
saved
tabs
appear
blank,
I
can't
load
any
new
pages
or
make
searches,
and
Firefox
won't
close
normally
and
I
have
to
kill
the
process.
It's
really
weird,
so
I
made
a
gif:
http://i.imgur.com/S1a8WXX.gif
I've
tried
all
of
the
following,
to
no
avail:
-
using
the
standard,
developer
and
nightly
versions.
-
repairing
Firefox
-
deleting
the
profile
-
disabling
the
antivirus
-
disabling
Smart
Screen
-
reinstalling
Windows
10
altogether
Just
leaving
the
name
of
the
executable
to
anything
else
than
'firefox'
seems
to
prevent
the
bug
from
reappearing.
I
have
mine
set
to
'firefix.exe',
and
after
a
few
reboots,
it
is
still
working.
I
don't
know
how
this
could
make
any
sense...
Update:
When
I
run
the
bugged
firefox.exe
with
the
-console
argument,
I
get
the
following
output:
https://pastebin.com/hZ90jRbz
Whereas
when
I
launch
the
working
firefix.exe,
it
only
prints
the
first
two
lines.
can't
get
into
facebook
without
going
to
private
window.
I
get
blank
screen
when
going
to
facebook
page
unless
i
go
to
private
window.
How
do
I
disable
'One-click
Search
Engines'
in
the
location
bar?
Since
Firefox
55,
the
'One-click
Search
Engines'
bar
containing
all
your
added
search
engines
that
shows
up
when
you
type
into
the
search
box
also
appears
in
the
location
bar.
How
do
I
remove
it?
Why
is
my
already
installed
FF
v54.0.1
not
asking
to
upgarde
to
v55.0.1
when
using
the
FF
'About'-window?
From
several
internet
sites
I
learned
that
FF
v55.0.1
is
out
for
some
days
already.
Normally
I
use
the
'?'
->
'About'
way-of-working
to
get
my
FF
updated,
but
currently
I
only
see
in
the
'About'
window
that
v54.0.1
(64
bits)
is
the
one
which
is
installed
and
there's
a
remark
'Firefox
is
up-to-date'.
Like
to
know
why
the
update
functionality
which
normally
works
fine,
is
currently
not
able
to
detect
the
v55.0.1
for
installment.
I
tried
to
add
troubleshoot
information
as
requested
and
clicked
on
'Automatically
add'
(https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/latest/troubleshooter/addon-426841-latest.xpi),
but
this
revealed
in
a
message
like
'We're
sorry,
but
we
could
not
find
what
you
where
looking
for'.
So,
I've
2
errors
here.
Adding
manually
the
troubleshoot
info
was
possible,
however,
see
attachment
Why
does
Firefox
slow
my
whole
OS?
Firefox
is
slow
on
my
computer
even
if
neither
my
RAM
nor
CPU
is
sonsumed.
I
made
tests
while
using
less
than
20%
of
each.
When
I
talk
about
'being
slow'
I
mean
that
even
my
pointer
is
slow.
It
lags
and
blinks
from
one
part
of
the
screen
to
another
one,
just
as
if
I
moved
it
but
without
displaying
any
animation.
It
seems
some
sort
of
frame
skipping
but
I
don't
really
know
if
that
is
the
reason.
This
applies
to
everything,
not
just
my
pointer.
If
something
else
runs
on
my
computer
-
let's
say
a
VoIP
chat
-
that
said
chat
has
the
same
issue:
audio
packages
are
not
played
until
the
pointer
starts
moving
again.
If
I
try
to
write
something
on
a
forum
or
in
a
firefox
page,
the
text
I
write
is
not
displayed
as
I
write
it
but,
much
like
the
pointer,
few
frames
after
I
write
it
and
every
letter
I
wrote
is
displayed
at
the
same
time.
Everything
only
happens
when
Firefox
is
the
active
window.
If
it
runs
in
background
everything
goes
smoothly.
If
not
for
that
Firefox
runs
pretty
well.
It
doesn't
crash,
it
loads
pages,
it
plays
videos
etc.
However
having
everything
running
slower
than
usual
is
quite
annoying.
Firefox
crashes,
restore
session
screen
Since
the
last
5
days,
Firefox
has
a
few
crashes
after
closing
the
browser
normally,
file
menu
or
the
X.
See
crash
report..
bp-ccd28f9c-ef78-4b64-af10-5ca720170810.
Now
everytime
I
open
the
browser
(Firefox
Developer
Edition
v56.0)
it
starts
with
a
Restore
Session
screen/tab
while
I
closed
the
browser
normal.
See
the
attached
screenshot.
How
can
I
fix
this?
Thanks....

Did
the
ability
to
override
'signatures.required'
option
get
removed?
'Starting

How

Sir
How
can
I

Theme
of

easily?
his
site
uses
HTTP
Strict

(HSTS)
to
specify
that
Firefox
may
only

to
it

As
a
result,
it
is
not
possible
to
add
an
exception
We

I
am
using
firefox
nightly
and
on
a
daily
basis
my
icon
keeps
changing
to
random
images,
why?
Since
about
two
days
ago,
my
firefox
nightly
icon
keeps
changing
to
random
images
not
related
to
firefox
and
I
cannot
find
the
issue.
How
can
I
disable
Tabs
Special
Abilities
when
dragging/tearing?
First,
I'm
not
interested
in
disabling
Tab
Tearing.
I
love
being
able
to
drag
a
tab
out
of
one
window
and
create
a
new
window.
What
I
am
interested
in
though
is
disabling
any
of
the
other
special
abilities
of
a
dragged
tab.
I
don't
know
what
that's
called
though
and
I
can't
find
it
when
Googling.
All
I
can
find
is
people
who
want
to
disable
tearing
altogether.
As
one
example,
if
I
have
VLC
open
in
Windows,
and
I
drag
a
tab
out
of
a
Firefox
54.0.1
(64-bit)
window
and
happen
to
land
over
the
VLC
window
it
won't
drop
the
tab
and
open
a
new
window.
It
feels
like
Firefox
wants
to
interact
with
VLC
somehow.
I
just
want
my
tabs
to
be
tabs.
I
don't
ever
want
them
to
interact
with
other
parts
of
the
OS.
If
I
DO
want
to
interact
with
other
parts
of
the
OS
then
I
grab
the
URL
in
the
Address
Bar
and
drag
that
instead.
Any
advice?
Thanks!
Can

After
years
of

I

All

Why
does
Firefox
want
to
load
almost
800MB
of
information
when
it
starts?
I
do
not
have

set
to
reload
my
last

However
it
always
wants
to
load
a
huge
amount
of
information
when

How
can
I
stop
it
from
doing
that?

Why

JavaScript
work?
I
am
running
Firefox

on
a

Why

Here's
an

As
you
can
see,
the
screen
is
blank
where
the

should
be.
I
looked
at

tried
the

Now
what?
Thanks.
Why
did
Facebook
messenger
stop
working
on
Firefox
mobile?
I
would
like
to
be
able
to
access
Messenger
via
web
browsers
on
my
Android
phone
rather
than
having
to
use
the
Messenger
app.
Since
the
latest
update
to
Firefox
(47),
I
lost
access
to
the
site.
The
Facebook
Messenger
page
redirects
me
to
the
Google
Play
store
to
download
the
Messenger
app.
Is
there
any
way
to
regain
access
to
the
Messenger
page?
I
would
prefer
not
having
to
download
any
more
applications
than
I
have
to
for
both
convenience,
privacy,
and
security
sake.
Bookmarks

FF
57
As
we
know
FF
57
removes
cuts
quite
a
few
of
the
add-ons
we've
been
using
to
deal
with
problems
that
have
been
popping
up,
among
them
Stylish.
Which
brings
me
to
the
old
problem
on
this
question:
https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/975714
From
what
I
understand,
the
given
userChrome.css
solution
in
that
question
is
only
for
the
sidebar,
does
it
work
for
bookmarks
drop-bar/window
as
well?
If
not,
could
someone
figure
the
correct
code?
Simple
explanations
how
to
actually
use
userChrome.css
would
be
nice.
*
Bit
unrelated,
but
is
it
be
possible
to
return
the
favicons
to
address-bar
using
userChrome.css?
FF's
upcoming
change
will
remove
the
add-ons
that
do
that,
so
I'm
reaching
for
other
solutions...

Hello.
My
Name
is
Dylaner.
Yesterday
i
had
9
fixed
tabs
on
my
mozilla
browser,
i
Also
use
chrome,
I
Was
playing
a
old
browser
game
and
i
made
the
bad
choice
of
Hibernate
the
computer,
when
lots
of
times
when
i
always
click
on
hibernate
my
Windows
10
Laptop,
it
almost
always
completly
Shutdown
my
PC,
no
idea
why.
I
Later
tried
to
confirm
and
yes
the
computer
was
shutdown,
and
i
didnt
care.
This
Afternoon
i
turned
my
lapton
On
and
started
Mozzila
from
my
toolbar...
-To
my
surprise
for
the
first
time
in
more
or
less
2
years
mozzila
was
asking
if
he
could
take
the
settings
from
either
internet-explorer,
chrome,
or
from
nowhere.
And
thats
where
I,
very
confusingly,
clicked
on.
Now
with
Mozzila
open
none
of
my
Tabs
exist
as
well
no
History
from
yeasterday
or
ever,
no
Passwords
saved
(i
had
atleast
15)
and
no
history
on
my
downloads
either.
Im
not
even
aiming
for
fixing
this
issue,
Im
just
wanted
to
know
if
its
even
possible
to
recover
ANYTHING
-
?
Thanks
in
advance
anyway.

Hello
community,
I
tried
everything
in
my
power
to
resolve
this
issue,
including
deleting
my
profile,
refreshing,
etc.
My
search
history
is
no

was
wiped
clean,
only
then
did
I
reset
my
entire
account),
and

very
sluggishly.

which
I
am
apparently
unable
to
remove,
even
if

would
be

I
can
think

(the

are:

-
neither
of
which
I
have
any
clue
how
to

I'm
not
a

expert
and
mystified
as
to
what
to
do
now
-
any
help
would
be
greatly
appreciated,
I'd
love
to
continue
using
firefox,
but
the
way
it
hangs
at
the
moment
it's
way
too
frustrating!
Thank
you
in
advance
for
your
time,
very
much
appreciated!
Can't
find
an
add-on
for
blocking
ads,
etc.
Firefox
has
gotten
out
of
control
Hardly
any
of
my
add-ons
work
anymore.
I
used
to
be
able
to
block
ads
especially
in
my
Yahoo
mail
but
no
longer
can
do
that.
Most
of
my
Add-ons
have
disappeared
for
some
reason.
Can
someone
give
me
some
links
to
add-ons
that
will
work
with
FF
55.0?
Firefox
seems
so
bloated
anymore.
Can
we
get
a
status
bar
on
full
screen
mode?
I
LOVE
the
full
screen
mode
that
you
guys
have
for
us!
Is
there
anyway
we
can
get
a
status
bar
that
pops
up
in
the
lower
left
corner
when
it's
going
to
a
new
address?
It
would
be
great
if
it
would
disappear
once
it
is
finished
loading
too.
For
me
it
would
make
the
full
screen
feature
(that
I
now
use
24/7)
AWESOME!
Thank
you
for
what
you
guys
do
for
us
and
your
time
and
effort!
What
can
I
edit
to
keep
Firefox

I
would
like
Firefox
to
stay
in

mode,
even
when
I
close
it
and
decide
to
open
it
again.
I
looked
around
in
the
about:config
but
didn't
find
really
anything
when
I
searched
'fullscreen'.
Thanks
guys!

just
recently,
when
Firefox
updated
to
v.
55
(laptop
doesn't
seem
to
have
the
same
problem,
being
v.
54).
When
attempting
to
view
Youtube-videos,
or
scrolling
past
Facebook-videos,
after
a
short
while,
the
whole
browser
will
crash,
often
without
being
able
to
provide
a
crash
report
(sometimes
it
crashes
immediately,
other
times
I
can
view
a
video
in
a
couple
of
minutes,
but
it
will
crash
sooner
or
later...).
I
have
attempted:
-
Changing
Firewall-settings
to
allow
Firefox
on
this
network,
-
'Refreshing'
(Resetting)
Firefox,
-
Disabling
media.wmf.enabled
under
about:config,
-
Uninstalling
and
re-installing
Firefox,
-
Updating
Flash,
-
Updating
Radeon
graphics-drivers
Yet
nothing
has
worked
thus
far.
As
mentioned,
it
has
only
begun
happening
after
having
updated,
but
I
don't
see
other
users
having
similiar
problems
with
this
version.
Thanks
in
advance.

bp-f6296904-d07f-4fe3-9e38-d47fe1170814
Cannot
even
open

even

And
even
after
refreshing
Firefox.
I
miss
it!!
Thank
you,
Jim
when
i
select
an
article
in
Powerpress
to
send
to
facebook,
it
gets
sent
to
wrong
page
I
am
on
the
POWUR
website.
When
I
go
to
marketing
and
choose
an
article
to
send
to
my
Facebook
page,
it
gets
sent
to
JoelMoore
FB
page
instead
of
solarforthepeople@gmail.com{FB
page}
The
toolbar
with
the
usual
tabs
(general,
addons
etc)
has
disappeared.
How
can
I
get
it
back?
There
is
normally
a
row
of
tabs
along
the
top
of
the
page
in
the
browser
-
things
like
general,
settings,
add-ons
etc.
This
has
suddenly
disappeared
-
how
can
I
recover
it?
How
do
I
remove
pulldown
for
email
addresses
I
have
entered
in
yahoo.mail.
Apparently
this
information
is
stored
somewhere.
I
assume
this
is
a
firefox
issue.
There
are
userid's
stored
somewhere
that
I
have
used
in
the
past.
Only
when
I
bring
up
Firefox
does
the
following
description
occur.
It
does
not
with
IE.
When
I
click
on
the
userid
field
for
yahoo
email,
userid
names
used
from
the
past
appear
for
me
to
select
from.
They
apparently
were
saved
without
my
knowledge.
It
also
happened
(pull
down
list)
when
I
submitted
this
form.
How
do
I
remove
all
userid's
from
Firefox,
so
no
userid
information
is
stored?
I
have
gone
under
options/security
and
unclicked
on
'Remember
logins'.
That
didn't
fix
my
problem.
I
am
also
not
remembering
history.
Second
question:
I
have
removed
Firefox
to
download
a
clean
copy.
I
removed
it
via
Windows
7
per
procedures.
After
I
download
and
reinstall,
all
my
book
marks
are
still
there.
It
use
to
be
that
once
you
deleted
Firefox,
ALL
files
were
moved
including
bookmarks.
Is
this
common
from
now
on.
If
so,
that
sure
isn't
a
clean
de-install.
When
I
go
to
a
website
(www.jci.org),
I
don't
see
the
ad
on
the
top,
left...only
the
word
'Advertisement'.
Why?
Using
Mozilla,
when
I
go
to
a
website
(www.jci.org),
I
don't
see
the
ad
on
the
top,
left...only
the
word
'Advertisement'.
Using
Internet
Explorer,
I
DO
see
the
ad.
Why
is
this?
Xfinity
text
messaging
does
not
work
on
Firefox.
It
does
work
on
IE.
I
am
using
Firefox
54.0.1.
I
can
log
into
Xfinity
and
access
my
account
and
email.
Xfinity
text
messaging
doed
now
work.
What
can
I
do?
Out
the
blue
all
my
bookmarks
on
my
home
pc
have
vanished.
I
reinstalled
mozilla
and
it
wont
go
to
the
sign
in
page
when
I
click
on
the
link.
When
I
click
on
the
sign
in
to
Sync
tab
the
browser
opens
a
new
window
to
a
blue
spinning
ball
that
never
works.
It
just
sits
there
and
spins
forever.
So
I
am
not
able
to
sign
in.
Where
is
the
Progress
Meter
in
Firefox
55.0
I'm
running
Fedora
25
with
Xfce,
fully
updated.
This
morning,
Firefox
was
upgraded
to
version
55.0
and
now
I
don't
have
a
progress
meter
any
more.
How
do
I
get
it
back?
'Start'=Facebook
login\\logout
for
user1
or
2
goes
(OK)
but
after
when
wanting
to
login
other
user;
drop-down
box
is
absent
of
other
user
selection.
When
I
open
Firefox
and
goto
Facebook
login
page,
I
find
both
my
user
1
and
2
(of
Facebook)
available
with
saved
passwords.
After
using
user1
or
2
and
logging
in\\out
from
Facebook;
I
find
the
Facebook
homepage
with
only
one
user
available
with
password
in
the
drop-down
box.
The
other
user
is
absent
from
the
choice
box
login.
When
I
close
Firefox
and
return
to
the
Facebook
homepage,
the
2
users
choice
have
returned
and
I
can
select
the
other
user
and
go
into
Facebook,
no
problem.
Both
users
saved
logins
are
store
in
Firefox.
Also
on
the
Facebook
page,
when
I
right
click
on
the
drop-box
menu,
I
find
a
menu
with
'Fill
Login'
choice
which
appears
and
both
users
are
there
with
passwords.
Basic
problem
boils
down
to
when
I
return
to
the
Facebook
page,
the
drop-box
menu
only
has
1
user
present.
Only
when
I
leave
Firefox
completely
and
return,
does
the
2
user
choice
return.
thank
you
Firefox
keeps
getting
an
'insecure
connection'
page,
and
flagging
sites
that
are
fine
with
invalids
certificate,
etc.
How
can
I
fix
this?

Can't
Select
Multiple
Tabs
Hi,
Not
sure
if
this
has
been
mentioned
somewhere
else,
but
if
it
is
I
couldn't
find
it.
Basically,
almost
all
browsers
all
users
to
select
multiple
tabs
by
holding
either
the
Ctrl/Shift
keys.
This
doesn't
work
in
Firefox,
which
seems
a
little
silly.
I
know
there's
an
add-on
that
makes
this
work,
but
I
shouldn't
need
an
add-on
to
be
able
to
do
what
is
considered
standard
behaviour
in
all
applications
that
have
tabbed
documents
(i.e.
not
just
web
browsers,
but
PDF
readers,
word
processors,
text
editors,
etc.).
This
is
pretty
much
the
only
thing
that
keeps
me
from
using
Firefox
as
my
default
browser.
Cheers!

Multirows

Hi

then
this
can

'Tab

we

at

'Refresh'
-
what
is
said,
and
what
it
does.
Confused.
Hi
folks,
I
am
one
of
a
few
people
using
FF
50.0
on
Raspbian/Jessie.
(That's
a
Raspberry
PI
running
Jessie.)
I
needed
this
version
to
allow
an
addon
to
work,
but
that's
ANOTHER
story.
Problem:
(The
config
I
have
now
is
'nothing'
compared
to
how
I
once
had
FF
running
on
THIS
machine.
5
windows,
100+
tabs
and
it
was
USABLE!
Today
it
is
2
windows
and
about
20
tabs
and
it
is
complaining.)
I
have
a
few
youtube
tabs
and
am
restoring
a
session.
I
see
a
message
about
'This
is
slow:
Fix
problem
/
Don't
tell
me
again.'
I
clicked
on
the
FIX
problem
and
was
told
about
'refreshing'
firefox
to
MAYBE
fix
the
problem.
Troubleshoot
firefox
and
press
REFRESH.
I
read
things
that
it
wipes
and
things
it
keeps.
But
this
is
different
to
what
I
read/understand
else
where.
Sorry
I
am
really
having
a
hard
time
tracking
what
is
where
just
now,
which
isn't
helping
the
bigger
problem
with
FF.
I
have
it
customised
FF.
Addons,
etc.
It
is
the
way
I
like
it.
But
as
I
was
about
to
press
the
button
I
read
'It
wipes
your
addons'
Now,
I
don't
mind
pressing
a
REFRESH
button
and
have
it
clean
out
'junk'
which
may
be
clogging
up
the
machine/program,
but
WIPING
MY
ADDONS!!??
Sure
it
says
it
puts
the
old
config
'on
your
desktop'......
That
is
windowz
talk.
I'm
using
Linux/Jessie.
I
am
not
sure
that
translates
correctly.
Also
I
don't
want
to
go
through
the
hassle
of
maybe
having
to
re-install
all
the
addons
(and
their
settings),
if
it
doesn't
work.
As
there
is
only
1
youtube
tab
being
loaded,
it
shouldn't
be
THAT
much
of
a
problem.
It
could
just
be
something
else
being
picky.
As
I
said,
I
have
run
it
with
5
windows
and
100+
tabs
open.
Though
that
was
the
Jessie
version,
not
the
'experimental'
version
that
this
is.
Can
someone
clarify
if
it
'wipes'
all
the
addons,
or
what
it
does.
I
am
tempted
to
'restart
with
all
addons
disabled'
to
see
what
happens.
But
thought
I
would
ask
because
of
the
differing
information
given
on
different
sites
about
what
happens.
Both
sites
Mozilla
sites.
Or
was
it
in
FF
that
I
read
it?
Anyway....
Thanks
in
advance.
How
can
I
join

am

How
to
make
the
Firefox
show
a
local
index.html
instead
of
a
directory
listing
I
have
a
set
of
HTML
files
on
my
disk,
and
I
want
to
browse
them
with
Firefox
without
a
web
server.
The
pages
don't
have
any
dynamic
content,
and
viewing
each
HTML
page
works
fine,
including
image,
CSS,
etc.
However,
these
HTML
pages
have
links
to
each
other,
and
clicking
on
them
does
not
always
work,
due
to
the
following
issue:
some
pages
are
named
'index.html'
and
instead
of
the
links
linking
to
a
name
containing
'index.html',
they
link
to
directory
names
(ending
in
'/').
If
the
whole
set
of
pages
(which
its
directory
structure)
was
copied
on
a
web
server,
everything
would
work,
as
the
web
server
would
map
URLs
of
directories
to
the
index.html
page.
When
using
Firefox
locally,
that
however
is
not
the
case
and
such
links
end
up
showing
the
directory
listing.
My
question
is:
Is
there
a
setting
somewhere
to
make
links
to
local
directories
instead
go
to
a
file
'index.html'
instead?

Website
Notifications
Disappearing
on
Mac
This
is
mostly
a
query
around
the
way
web
push
notifications
work;
I
use
www.wrike.com
for
their
project
management
software.
I
will
get
a
push
notification
to
let
me
know
when
someone
edits
or
updates
a
task
on
their
site.
If
I
click
this
notification
straight
away,
it
behaves
as
expected
and
directs
me
to
the
updated
task.
If
I
miss
the
notification
though,
it
will
not
be
in
my
Mac's
notification
centre,
it
disappears
completely.
Now,
I
always
have
a
Firefox
window
open
with
wrike.com
loaded
up
already,
is
this
why
the
notification
disappears
immediately
-
because
Firefox
has
seen
that
I
am
on
the
website
that
sent
the
push
notification,
and
it
therefore
dismisses
said
notification?
If
so,
is
there
any
way
of
editing
this
functionality?
If
I'm
on
a
call
or
not
in
front
of
my
computer
for
a
second
and
miss
the
notification,
then
I
have
no
way
of
getting
back
to
it
without
going
to
the
site
and
tracking
down
the
change
manually.
Thanks!

do
I
get
Firefox
to
allow
a
site
to
open
a
new
page
without
asking
me
first?
I
do
not
want
to
have
to
click
on
the
ALLOW
button
for
a
new
page.
Help?

Can
I
recover
lost
search
history,
when
saving
search
history
is
disabled?
(finally
activated
account
properly...)
Hi,
I
disabled
search
history,
and
restarted
Firefox.
Oh
and
eventually
lost
a
thousand
tabs
in
half
a
second!
I
then
had
several
windows
open,
each
with
many
tabs
on
them
'critically
needed.'
My
Laptop's
processor
power
began
to
slow
down
over
time!
So
I
hurried
on
over
to
the
'Task
Manager'
ASAP
(boy
what
a
mistake
that
was...)
which
I'm
totally
completely
unfamiliar
with
besides
'Youtube
knowledge.'
To
which
I
close
the
page
that
was
'freezing
up'
over
all
others,
by
'Ending
Process'
there
in
the
'Task
Manager!'
This
led
to
all
of
Firefox
closing,
then
getting
back
onto
Firefox,
only
to
see
an
automatic
update
occurring
before
getting
back
into
the
browser.
I'm
wondering
how
may
I
get
back
the
lost
history
in
this
special
situation
that
had
me
nearly
in
tears
because
of
how
much
lost
history
was
there.
It
felt
almost
equivalent
to
a
heartbreak
from
a
cheating
girlfriend,
only
worse!
Haha!
Just
kidding,
not
worse,
but
I
felt
the
pain
as
if
a
monsoon
storm
of
rain,
flooding,
thunder,
lightning,
and
tornado's
were
happening
inside
my
brain,
working
it's
way
to
my
heart.
It
felt
almost
as
if
an
asteroid
from
the
'Armageddon'
movie
was
about
to
hit
my
Heart
here
on
Earth
specifically
targeted
and
aimed
at
me
by
some
drunk
aliens
with
gravity
manipulation
telekinetic
powers.
It
was
like
a
total
frankenstein
awakens
moment
for
me,
and
a
Hulk
mode
was
about
to
activate
from
deep
within
me,
until
I
suddenly
realized
how
a
movie
can
make
the
pain
all
go
away,
and
so
can
a
celebration
for
this
pain!
After
this
savage
beastly
bloody
hell
of
an
occurrence,
from
Hell!
I
still
managed
to
have
some
of
it
memorized
wrapped
in
a
12
pack
of
cigars
I
smoked
all
at
once,
with
a
nice
friendly
grin
on
my
face
as
though
lost
and
completely
clueless
as
to
what
just
happened.
Followed
by
a
Hangover
with
the
'Wolf
Pack.'
All
jokes
aside
though
since
I
don't
smoke
or
drink.
I
need
a
way
to
recover
the
search
history
altogether.
I
have
researched
Index.dat
options,
and
a
few
other
recovery
software
that
can
discover
the
lost
files,
but
haven't
tried
them
yet,
as
I
thought
I
would
come
here
first.
Would
very
much
appreciate
the
support!
Sorry
about
this
but,
in
need
of
saving
from
sadness,
and
sparing
my
heart
with
some
support.

Hi!

Hey
guys,
I
have
a
problem,
which
is
not
good
news
for
me.
While
I
was
searching
through
website
I
turned
off
my
monitor
and
about
5
minutes
later
I
turned
on
and
I
saw
Firefox
crashed
randomly
on
my
computer.
I
don't
know
what
caused
it,
but
Firefox
is
crashing
sometimes
within
10
days.
Probably
an
application
or
an
extension.
Any
help?

Any

on
a
fix
for
Firefox?
Lately
everytime
I
open
Firefox
it
goes
thru
an
update.
Why?
Just
in
the
last
couple
weeks,
every
time
I
open
up
Firefox,
it
says
it
needs
to
update.
Why,
every
time.
There
can't
be
update
every
time,
multiple
time
per
day.
Everytime
I
restart
firefox,
all
my
extensions
get
disabled
So
everytime
I
restart
firefox,
my
extensions,
such
as
adblocker,
are
not
enabled.
More
specifically,
even
though
they
appear
as
enabled,
they
are
not
functioning
for
some
reason.
Also,
I
noticed
somethign
interesting.
Adblocker
plus,
when
enabled
and
functioning
has
3
tabs
appearing
on
it.
First
says
'Options',
second
says
'Disable',
third
says
'Remove'.
However,
when
I
start
firefox
the
first
tab
is
not
there,
even
though
it
says
that
it
is
enabled,
and
of
course,
it
is
not
functioning.
Other
add-ons
dont
work
too,
but
they
dont
have
this
extra
'options'
tab,
so
I
mentioned
adblocker
for
reference.
The
temporary
fix
that
I
have
found
is
that
when
I
click
on
the
'Disable'
tab
and
then
the
'Enable'
bar
that
appears,
the
add-on
is
enabled
and
fully
functioning
again,
but
of
course
this
is
not
a
viable
solution
if
I
have
many
add-ons
and
not
a
very
practical
one.
This
problem
appeared
on
new
OS.
I
just
did
a
clean
installation
of
my
PC,
going
from
Windows
7
to
Windows
10,
so
maybe
its
Windows
10
related.
Lastly,
I
would
like
to
mention
that
I
have
already
tried
deleting
the
extension
and
ini
files
etc,
but
nothing
has
worked...I
even
deleted
all
the
mozzila
and
firefox
files
in
my
User/Apps
directory,
then
unistalled
and
reinstalled
firefox,
but
even
that
didnt
work..So
it
seems
like
a
OS
issue
to
me.

Educated

Suddenly
Nothing
Works
Going
about
my
business,
not
doing
anything,
just
sitting
and
watching
a
YouTube
video,
when
suddenly
the
tab
crashes.
I
think
it's
probably
a
one
off
and
ignore
it.
The
week
that
followed
lead
to
the
problem
getting
progressively
worse,
to
the
point
where
opening
anything
other
than
a
new
tab
caused
the
tab
to
crash.
Unrelated,
I'd
noticed
some
other
performance
issues,
and
was
thinking
about
resetting
windows
on
my
computer
anyway.
Long
story
short,
I
did
that,
downloaded
the
latest
version
of
Firefox,
installed
it,
and
within
seconds
the
tab
that
loads
when
you
first
install
Firefox,
crashed.
I
tried
doing
the
'refresh
firefox'
thing
through
the
help
menu
anyway,
even
though
it
couldn't
get
more
fresh
than
that,
and
that
did
nothing.
I
can't
do
anything,
even
while
writing
this
the
tab
has
crashed
once.
I
don't
really
see
any
other
option
but
to
use
a
different
browser
at
this
point.
Simply
put,
if
a
fresh
install
of
Firefox
doesn't
work
on
a
fresh
install
of
Windows,
I
don't
really
have
much
faith
in
it
anymore.
My
e-retail
site
now
crashes
when
im
working
on
a
certain
page
to
create
and
manage
products.
This
never
happened
before
after
several
years.
I've
been
using
firefox
for
years
on
my
primary
PC
to
work
on
my
ecommerce
site.
However,
recently,
when
I
access
a
specific
page
in
my
ecommerce
back
office,
the
area
used
to
create
and
manage
products,
the
page
freezes
and
I
am
unable
to
work.
There
are
product
drop
down
options
within
this
page,
for
product
options,
this
causes
it
to
crash
and
freeze
the
page,inexplicably.
This
issue
of
freezing
does
not
occur
on
chrome,explorer
or
even
on
my
other
PC'S
that
have
older
versions
of
firefox.
It
works
fine
on
my
laptop
and
another
desktop
-with
firefox.
But
I
think
they
have
older
versions.
I
prefer
to
use
this
PC
to
work
(dual
screen)
and
am
at
wits
end.I've
tried
safe
mode
and
re-installing
firefox,
with
no
success.

How

Firefox
will
not
import
bookmarks
and
stops
responding
My
Firefox
browser
stopped
showing
my
tabs
on
the

page.
so
I
tried
to
update
the
browser.
Unfortunately
the
version
I
had
was
the
version
immediately
preceding
the
release
of
v.
55.
and
would
not
update.
So
I
installed
55.
I
now
had
no
tabs
page
at
all.
Sick
of
this
trouble,
I
uninstalled
Firefox
and
reinstalled
the
entire
program,
with
much
difficulty.
I
had
backed
up
my
bookmarks
to
both
a
.json
file
and
an
.html
file
to
be
safe.
Now
every
time
I
attempt
to
import
the
bookmarks
from
either
of
those
two
files,
firefox
hangs
and
'stops
responding'
leaving
no
choice
but
to
quit
the
program
and
try
again.
Nothing.
Every
time
it
is
the
same.
after
multiple
attempts,
I
am
now
here
with
no
browser,
using
Chrome
which
has
no
'newtab'
feature
at
all
(other
than
the
'latest'
pages),
and
lacks
numerous
other
customizable
features.

Mozilla
and
Microsoft
both
continually
do
this
to
us.

that
fails,
over
and
over
at
the
most
basic
tasks.
PLEASE
HELP
ME,
how
do
I
import
my
bookmarks
and
all
my
passwords
and
old
data
from
my
now
defunct
setup?
This
is
not
fun
and
games
for
us
out
here.
So
frustrating,
and
so
little
help
anywhere.
Suicide
might
help?
Firefox
55
cannot
import
bookmarks
or
nor
any
previous
browser
data.
My
question
disappeared
so
I'm
trying
again.
Why
is
it
not
possible
to
import
bookmarks
and
browser
data
any
more.
I
had
a
sequence
of
horrible
experiences
with
trying
to
get
Firefox
to
do
its
basic
functions
tonight,
starting
with
the
disappearance
of
my
newtab
page.
This
then
led
me
to
try
to
update
the
browser
to
the
newest
version.
First,
I
backed
up
my
data.
Including
backing
up
the
bookmarks
two
times
to
.html
and
.json
files,
both
of
which
are
saved.
Of
course,
the
new
installation
of
Firefox
is
unable
to
read
the
old
profile.
Of
course,
because
if
it
were
able
to
do
that
the
user
would
not
have
to
suffer.
Once
a
version
of
Firefox
was
finally
installed,
I
tried
to
import
my
bookmarks.
I
have
tried
to
perform
this
simple
task
12
times;
every
time
I
try
to
do
it,
Firefox
hangs
and
'is
not
responding.'
Then
the
only
option
is
to
shut
down
Firefox
because
it
is
incapable
of
doing
anything
at
all.
Yes,
I
have
latest
updates
to
Windows
10.
yes
I
'm
a
chronic
user
of
Windows
and
Firefox
and
yes,
they
never
work
right.
Can
anyone
PLEASE,
PLEASE
describe
in
relatively
simple
terms
how
to
get
a
version
of
Firefox
that
works
the
way
it
did
before
the
August
10
security
update
(I
presume
that
is
the
culprit)
destroyed
the
newtab
page,
and
then
the
new
point
upgrade
of
Firefox
completely
fails
to
allow
the
importation
of
Bookmarks,
to
say
nothing
of
passwords
and
everything
else
that
is
saved
in
my
profile
from
before.
Please
help!!,
there
is
a
lot
of
work
pressure
on
us
out
here,
and
using
Windows
10
and
Firefox
which
are
continually
sabotaged
by
the
software
developers,
causes
immense
stress.
Thank
you
so
much
in
advance.

Hi
I
need
do
get
the
firefox
profile
-
what
ever
that
is-
up
and
running
asap
again.
In
the
middle
of
a
session
using
Firefox,
suddenly
popped
up
a
field
that
I
had
not
been
using
firefox
for
a
long
time,
which
is
simple
not
true.
I
use
it
daily.
After
having
started
what
was
suggested,
I
stopped
the
process
of
updating,
because
I
thought
it
is
a
bug
or
so.
After
stopping
this
I
now
can
by
no
means
get
firefox
up
and
running
again,
not
by
deleting,
not
by
reinstalling,
the
message
stays:
'Profile
Missing.
Your
Firefox
profile
cannot
be
loaded.
It
may
be
missing
or
inaccessible.'
It
is
not
OK
and
having
such
a
button
after
such
an
information
below
is
of
no
help
at
all.
Today
is
just
not
the
time
for
playing
around,
I
need
to
work
with
it
and
need
urgent
help.
Who
ever
of
the
developers
created
this
popup
for
such
profil
updates:
The
teaser
was
incorrect,
the
update
was
unnecessary
and
please
make
sure
to
not
have
these
windows
at
the
bottom
of
the
Firefox
window
pop
up
unwanted
any
more.
More
over
please
make
sure
to
help
now
and
set
up
a
new
profile
or
whatever,
since
hours
this
blocks
me
from
working.
Or
being
convinced
of
firefox,
you
simply
stopped
me
using
firefox
in
an
instant.
And
after
reading
the
help
files
and
none
did
help,
it
seems
that
this
has
happened
since
years,
reading
the
community
hints,
however
none
of
their
suggestions
helps
me
now:
Please
get
in
touch
now!!!
Thanks
a
lot
from
a
desperate
user!

Captchas
not
displaying
across
all
sites.
I
recently
discovered
this
problem
seemingly
out
of
nowhere
a
few
weeks
ago
-
I
tried
logging
into
IGN
but
couldn't
because
it
needed
me
to
enter
a
Captcha,
only
the
Captcha
wasn't
displaying.
Since
then
I've
found
that
any
website
that
requires
a
Captcha
isn't
displaying
them.
I've
tried
various
possible
solutions
I've
found
online,
and
I've
refreshed
Firefox
and
am
running
it
vanilla
(in
Windows
7
64-bit)
right
now,
but
the
problem
still
persists.
Flash,
Shockwave
Player,
and
Java
are
all
up
to
date.
I've
looked
through
my
antivirus
programs
(Bitdefender
and
Malwarebytes)
and
they
don't
appear
to
be
blocking
Captchas
-
I've
not
changed
their
settings
at
all,
and
I've
been
running
them
since
before
the
issue
popped
up.
It's
really
annoying,
because
I've
had
to
resort
to
using
my
phone
for
certain
websites,
and
that's
something
I'd
really
rather
not
do,
and
shouldn't
have
to
do.
Any
help
would
be
appreciated.

to

problem.

uninstalled

and
reinstalled
it

I
installed
it
without
adding
any
browsing
history,
etc.
I
have
scanned

would

Firefox
now
opens
a
new
window,
not
a
new
tab
when
I
click
on
a
bookmark
or
the
+,
or
when
I
start
a
new
download,
regardless
of
settings.
Firefox
now
opens
a
new
window,
rather
than
a
new
tab
when
I
click
on
a
bookmark
or
the
+,
or
when
I
start
a
new
download,
regardless
of
Tabs
settings
in
the
Options
General
page.
This
is
different
from
original
behavior,
and
I
have
no
idea
what
happened.
How
do
I
change
back
to
Tabs
rather
than
window?
Multi-staged
rollout
on
Windows
10
slows
browser
down.
I
upgraded
to
WIndows
10,
changed
to
x64
version
and
migrated
my
profile.
It
coincided
with
55.0.1
update.
Suddenly
Firefox
started
to
work
slow
as
hell
-
pages
take
several
minutes
instead
of
seconds
previously,
all
other
tabs
freeze
during
this,
cannot
even
scroll
or
target
window.
When
I
forcibly
turned
off
multi-staged
rollout
problems
ceased
-
no
more
dead
freezing,
reasonable
loading
times.
So,
what
the
fuck
have
you
stuffed
into
that
plugin,
and
why'd
you
released
it
without
minimal
testing?
Or
speed
isn't
as
important
as
preparing
to
be
additional
theme
of
Chrome?
Safari
won't
allow
Firefox.
Safari
content
blocker
will
not
allow
me
to
select
Firefox
focus.
The
remember
logins
for
sites
option
is
unchecked
each
time
I
re/start
Firefox.
How
can
I
get
it
to
permanently
remain
checked?
I
had
installed
Trend
Micro
Password
Manager
with
Firefox
54.0.1
(32-bit).
I
decided
not
to
use
it
and
uninstalled
it.
Now,
the
Remember
logins
for
sites
option
only
works
if
I
check
the
box
each
time
Firefox
is
started.
How
so
I
get
that
option
to
stay
on
permanently?
After
I
send
GMAILs
with
images
and
later
look
at
the
sent
message,
I
sometimes
find
text
in
place
of
the
image
that
reads
'Inline
image
1'.
How
do
I
fix?
It
is
very
inconsistent,
but
when
I
copy
and
paste
images
from
websites,
sometimes
these
images
remain
intact
on
the
messages
after
the
message
is
sent,
but
sometimes
when
the
message
is
viewed
later
on,
the
term
'inline
image'
appears
in
place
of
the
image
itself.
I
prefer
Firefox
over
Chrome.
But
I
understand
that
Chrome
because
of
its
connection
with
Google,
has
overcome
this
problem.
Is
there
a
similar
fix
for
Firefox?
So
that
I
can
continue
using
my
Gmail
on
Firefox?
Thanks.

Firefox
pages
disappear
when
scrolling
Suddenly
a
week
ago,
possibly
after
a
Windows
7
Pro
update,
I
started
having
problems
with
Firefox:
scrolling,
or
even
just
moving
the
cursor
or
clicking
(or,
alternatively,
using
:'Page
Down'
on
keyboard)
would
result
in
a
complete
blank-out
of
the
screen
about
50%
of
the
time.
This
is
SPECIFIC
to
Firefox.
This
problem
does
not
happen
in
Chrome
or
Explorer
let
alone
any
other
program
type.
I
did
all
these
things,
to
no
avail:
reinstalled
Firefox,
trouble-shot
display,
downloaded
drivers,
tried
a
different
monitor,
tried
more
updates
from
Windows,
replaced
the
graphics
card,
etc.
I
finally
tried
a
System
Restore
(successful),
but
that
did
not
fix
the
problem
at
all.
So
I
'Undo'ed
the
Restore
-
or
tried
to
anyway.
It
crashed
my
Dell
Precision
(pro-grade
workstation
just
over
a
year
old).
It
crashed
so
badly,
it
is
now
at
a
computer
repair
shop
---
and
they
were
able
to
fish
my
operating
system
from
black-screen
oblivion
---
and
they
see
the
same
Firefox
problem
and
are
just
as
perplexed
as
me
about
why
it
should
happen.
I
like
Firefox
enough
to
have
gone
through
all
this
--
days
of
frustration,
no
computer,
etc
--,
but
so
far
for
all
my
efforts
it's
hundreds
of
dollars
wasted
and
a
week
of
reinstalling
all
my
programs.....
Ugh.
Anyone
having
similar
experiences
or
better
yet,
fixes?
Thanks.

How
to
stop
Firefox
from
superimposing
search/address
bar
over
tabs?
Earlier
today
my
Comodo
IceDragon
updated
itself
to
v52.0.0.4,
after
which
the
search
bar
had
vanished
and
only
appears
when
I
place
the
cursor
over
any
open
tabs.
This
happens
instantly
and
prevents
me
from
accessing
any
tabs.
I
have
the
Classic
Theme
Restorer
addon
installed
but
cannot
find
any
option
that
will
solve
this.
In
desperation
I
opened
Firefox
thinking
that
I
would
at
least
be
able
to
use
that
but
it
too
has
the
same
problem.
How
do
I
override
this
and
get
back
to
2
different
toolbars,
one
for
tabs
and
one
for
the
search/address
bar
please?

Firefox
not
correctly
loading/interacting
with
some
websites
I
have
used
Firefox
on
both
Windows
and
Mac
systems
for
many
years
with
no
problem.
Recently
I
have
experienced
several.
In
one
case
a
website
that
i
have
logged
onto
for
at
lest
10
years
was
displayed
incorrectly
and
would
not
accept
my
password.
It
ran
perfectly
in
Safari.
This
problem
was
cured
by
clearing
the
cache
and
cookies.
Currently,
I
cannot
load
comments
to
the
'comments'
sections
of
Wall
Street
Journal
articles
-
a
message
tells
me
that
I
am
trying
to
load
'malformed
content'
Again,
the
site
functions
correctly
in
Safari.
In
contrast
however,
clearing
cache,
cookies
and
history
does
not
restore
functionality
in
Firefox.
What
has
changed?
Firefox
Hangs
when
archiving
an
email
with
GMAIL
While
using
GMAIL,
when
I
archive
a
message
or
when
I
jump
from
folder
to
folder
to
review
emails,
firefox
hangs
and
need
to
reload
or
close
to
fix
Firefox
providing
unauthorized
form
data
54.0.1
32
bit
I
am
using
web
version
54.0.1
32
bit.
I
browse
in
private
mode
and
basically
have
firefox
as
private
and
secure
as
possible
as
my
standard
approach.
Recently,
I
have
been
looking
for
a
job
and
using
the
'easily
apply'
options
from
indeed.com.
In
such
case,
there
is
a
limited
form
to
fill
out
which
includes
name,
phone
#
and
a
few
other
fields.
I
rarely
fill
out
the
phone
#
field
and
leave
it
blank.
On
more
than
one
occasion,
the
confirmation
email
that
I
get
from
the
submission
is
showing
that
a
phone
#
was
provided.
I
talked
to
indeed.com
and
they
say
it
is
the
browser,
but
the
field
is
definitely
NOT
populated
by
me
nor
and
remains
blank
during
submission.
Can
anyone
suggest
a
cause
and
solution
here.
I
can't
save
bookmarks
to
the
bookmarks
bar.
HELP
!!!
I
can't
save
my
favorite
bookmarks
to
the
bookmarks
bar.
Whenever
I
open
a
website
and
try
to
drag
it
to
the
bar,
It
does
not
work.
I
have
tried
everything!!!
Please
help.

I
received
a
critical
update
to
day
from
this
site
'https://cheactherenegadesystem.com'
labeled
as
a
critical
'firefox-patch.js'.
Is
this
update
really
yours?
I
received
an
update
from
a
questionable
web
site
as
listed
in
my
original
question.
'the
authenticity
of
the
received
data
could
not
be
verified'
-
due
only
to
satellite
connection
latency.
Why
block
it?
Recently
I
am
getting
the
message
'the
authenticity
of
the
received
data
could
not
be
verified'
from
sites
which
are
usually
not
blocked
by
Firefox.
It
is
pretty
clear
from
the
initial
part
of
the
error
message
'The
connection
to
the
server
was
reset
while
the
page
was
loading.'
that
this
is
due
to
long
latency
gaps
in
the
very
slow
satellite
broadband
inflicted
on
rural
Australians
by
the
national
government
through
NBN.
Tried
to
upload
a
screenshot
of
the
error
message
-
won't
load
because
the
satellite
broadband
is
so
slow
-
see
what
I
mean.
But
I
don't
expect
to
be
penalised
by
Firefox
because
of
this.
By
all
means
tell
me
that
there
may
be
an
authenticity
problem
and
then
let
me
decide
whether
to
ignore
it
or
act
on
it.
I
don't
need
a
nanny
browser.
But
on
a
technical
basis,
why
can't
Firefox
distinguish
between
this
issue
and
received
data
which
really
has
authenticity
problems?
Firefox
is
not
letting
me
access
my
email
through
Comcast.
I
am
trying
to
access
my
email
through
Comcast
and
Firefox
won't
open
it
because
of
a
pop-up.
Why
can
I
not
download
s3
organizer?
I
had
s3
organizer
on
my
Firefox
up
until
a
few
days
ago.
Firefox
now
says
that
it
has
been
disabled
from
my
computer,
and
will
not
allow
me
to
add
it
again.
It
says
the
add-on
is
not
compatible
with
my
version
of
Firefox,
however,
I
have
the
most
update
version.
Can
you
please
assist?

Firefox
print
preview
won't
close
so
I
can't
go
back
to
what
I'm
working
on
in
the
browser.
I
have
close
out
Firefox
then
re-open
it
and
restore
my
tabs.
This
is
new
and
has
never
happened
to
me
before,
but
its
been
continuously
doing
this
all
day
today
and
it's
causing
my
work
to
take
twice
as
long
to
do.
I
keep
hitting
the
'close'
button
at
the
top
and
waiting
for
something
to
happen,
but
it
won't.
I've
tried
'CTRL-R'
to
see
if
I
can
get
it
to
refresh
or
anything,
but
nothing
will
work.
Only
thing
I
can
do
is
close
out
Firefox,
but
then
it
does
it
again
on
the
next
thing
I
try
using
it
on
and
I
HAVE
to
be
able
to
use
this
feature.
Using
Nightly,
when
I
open
a
new
tab,
why
doesn't
the
cursor
show
up
automatically
in
the
URL
bar?
Using
Nightly
-
when
I
open
a
new
tab
using
the
+
button
in
the
tab
bar,
I
then
have
to
click
in
the
URL
bar.
Using
regular
Firefox,
the
cursor
is
automatically
in
the
URL
bar
so
I
can
immediately
start
typing.
It's
just
a
minor
issue,
but
it's
been
annoying
me.
If
I
use
ctrl-T,
the
cursor
is
there
as
expected.

how
to
set
language
I've
been
using
beta
versions
of
Firefox
on
my
iMac
for
ages.
It
always
updated
automatically.
Now
all
of
a
sudden,
it
doesn't
do
so
anymore.
After
manually
downloading
the
latest
version
(56.0b2),
the
language
in/of
all
the
menus
is
English
instead
of
Dutch.
And
when
I
go
to
preferences,
I
only
get
4
options,
instead
of
the
8
option
Firefox
55.0.1
shows
me
on
my
Macbook
Air.
Which
BTW
uses
the
Dutch
language
as
it
should
(for
all
the
menus).
How
do
I
tell
56.0b2
that
it
should
use
the

language
on
my

and
how
do
I
get
those
other
4
options
back?

Hi
there,
My
name
is
Pouya
Zargoosh,
and
I
have
some
important
question
for
you
to
ask.
Do
you
know
how
can
I
change
Mozilla
Firefox
resolution
from
720p
to
1080p
to
take
a
screenshot
or
record
at
that
resolution
because
I
used
Internet
Explorer
that
supports
1080p,
but
the
problem
is
that
either
taking
a
screenshot
or
recording
gives
me
a
black
screen
all
the
time.
I
appreciate
it
if
you
let
me
know
ASAP.

remove
IBM
security
rapport
addon
In
the
addons
manager
list
is
IBM
security
rapport
1.4
with
the
only
option
to
either
enable/disable
it.
It
recently
downloaded
itself
with
a
firefox
update
so
cannot
say
where/when
it
came
from.
I
realise
that
firefox
are
trying
to
help
by
adding
it
to
the
list
but
in
this
case
the
addon
is
useless
as
it
does
not
allow
you
to
add
new
web
sites
to
be
protected.
Therefore
I
need
to
remove
it
as
it's
impacting
on
my
original
rapport
trusteer
program
as
if
I
update
my
rapport
program
it
only
updates
this
addon.
Any
ideas
how
you
can
remove
it
from
the
addon
manager
list?

How
can
I
make
sure
that
the
information
on
a
certain
topic
never
appears
in
the

For
example,
I
do
not
want
to
read
news
about
horses
or
about
one
of
the

How
can
I
ensure
that
my

not

i

it
did
not
happen
before
i

i
just
want

i
can't

The
next
Firefox
55.0.1
problem,
Ghostery
is
causing
FF
to
hang-
be
very
slow.
Hi
Since
the
update
to
Firefox
55.0.1
I
have
had
a
number
of
add-on
related
problems.
The
one
I
am
currently
trying
to
resolve
is
that
Ghostery
is
causing
FF
to
hang
-
become
very
slow.
All
functions
are
slow,
(loading
pages,
opening
tabs,
typing,
etc)
even
starting
FF
with
Ghostery
running
is
slow.
If
I
disable
Ghostery
and
re
enable
all
other
(10)
add-ons
FF
is
back
to
its
usual
(very
fast)
speed)
Is
anyone
else
having
this
issue,
are
there
any
solutions?
Thanks
My

Is

does
it

is
this
a

As
my
question
asked
above
Images
are
reduced
to
stripes
I've
a
webpage
with
images
that
can
be
browsed
several
ways.
After
opening
all
images
are
shown
as
'stripes'.
However,
when
I
resize
Firefox'
window,
the
images
are
shown
right.
Does
not
matter
if
I
maximize
or
just
resize
the
window
a
little
bit.
And
after
that
I
can
refresh
the
page
(CTRL-F5)
and
the
images
are
stripes
again.
This
issue
does
not
occur
in
other
browsers.
What's
happening
here?
See
e.g.

Hello
and

I
use

an
annoying
characteristic.
Every

after
I

this

called

The

loads
with
the
scrollbar
already
down
about
2
inches
from
the
top
of
the
page,
with
the

scrollbar
moved
down

I
would
like
to
find
a

to

it,

is
always

any
more

could

Also,
I
can

bursts
of

does
seem
to
be
related

it's
not

whether
I'm

How

I

I
took

no

#1
--
a
virus
window
hijacked
my
browser.
The
virus
displayed
on
the
screen
and
i
was
not
able
to
use
the
browser
at
all.
It
had
Mozilla
Firefox
at
the
top
and
stated
that
i
MUST
call
this
number
to
fix
it.
I
used
a
burner
number
and
called.
It
was
a
male
with
a
middle-eastern
accent,
who
told
me
that
he
HAD
to
remote
connect
to
my
computer!
I
said
no
thanx
and
hung
up!
So
i
did
a
control
alt
delete
and
closed
the
window.
I
used
microsoft
edge
to
download
the
newest
version
of
firefox
and
uninstalled
the
old
version.
#2
--
now
there
is
a
header
at
the
top
of
my
gmail
page
stating
that
my
current
firefox
browser
is
not
supported,
with
a
link
to
download
the
new
version.
My
firefox
IS
up-to-date
b/c
i
just
installed
the
newest
version!
#3
--
there
is
a
popup
at
the
bottom
of
my
gmail
page
stating
that
it
looks
like
i
reinstalled
firefox
and
do
i
want
'them'
to
clean
it
up?!
#4
--
when
i
launch
firefox
a
popup
for
fireshot
screen
capture
quickly
opens
and
then
disappears.
It
has
never
done
that
before!
#5
--
in
the
toolbar,
the
firefox
icon
shows
2
windows
open,
however
there
is
only
one!
When
i
right
click
it,
the
only
tabs
and
windows
showing
up
are
the
exact
ones
i
have
open.
I've
also
minimized
my
current
window
and
there
is
no
other
window
open!
#6

i
updated
my

defender
and
ran
2

which
found
nothing.
I
am
using
an
ASUS
TP500L
laptop
with
Windows

I
need
to
report
this
to

Any
help
would
be
greatly
appreciated!
I
have
multiple

for
different
uses.
Two
days

stopped

same
time.
WTF?
Linux

I
pretty
much
said
everything
in
the
question.
I
think
I
installed
a
Firefox
update
and
my
profiles
stopped
working
in
the
pulldown
menu
upper
right.
It
gives
the
name
of
the
profile
I
am
using
but
will
not
let
me
use
the
profiles
menu
that
was
there
when
I
put
the
mouse
over
my
profile
name.
Now
I
get
nothing.
It
really
screws
me
up
when
I
am
on
a
site
where
I
have
multiple
accounts
and
want
to
log
in
to
them
simultaneously.

Can't
restore
exported

bookmarks
from
windows

I
have
exported
bookmarks
on
my
windows
7
and
try
to
import
to
waterfox
(
the
same
version
)
on
my
windows
10,
and
nothing
happened.
Also,
I
made
backup
of
bookmarks
on
my
WF
on
win7
and
tried
to
restore
it
on
WF
on
my
Win
10
and
I
get
a
message:
'This
will
replace
all
of
your

with

backup.
'Are
you
sure?
If
I
press
Yes
button
I
get
next
one:
'Unable

Also,
I
have
logged
in
WF
with
my

account
to
both
windows
on
two
different
pc's.
Only
what
I
get
on
my

is
synced

What
Should
I
do
in
order
get
bookmarks
on
my
new
pc
with
windows
10,
beside
all
I
did.
Is
there
any
simple
way
to
copy

bookmarks

from

and
to

to

Hello,
my
pc
have
a
problem
I
did
a
test
on
two
computers
and
they
lost
a
port
that
connected
to
many
websites,
I
think
your
program
should
be
doing
this
thing
to
delete
files
because
I
installed
programs
on
both
PCs
and
gave
the
same
shit,
as
I
said
at
the
beginning,
Firefox
was
installed
on
both
PCs,
check
the
program
codes
and
fix
that
shit
if
that's
happening.

why

it's

at

the

Now
I
can't

the

An

doesn't
even
include
the

GUI
Firefox
hangs
when
I
try
to
load
the
GUI
for
my
Ubiquiti
Edgerouter.
I've
asked
on
their
forums
with
no
response
so
I
thought
I
would
try
here
as
well.
I
have
had
the
problem
running:
Firefox
54.0.1
32-bit
on
Windows
10
Nightly
57.0a1
(2017-08-09)
64-bit
on
Windows
10
Firefox
52.3.0esr-1
on
Debian
9
If
I
wipe
out
my
profile
and
start
over
it
will
work
well
until
I've
loaded
4
or
5
different
GUIs
(I
have
12
of
the
devices)
and
then
the
problem
comes
back.
For
add-ons
I
am
using
HTTPS
Everywhere
and
Privacy
Badger.
I've
tried
disabling
them
with
no
luck.
The
GUI
loads
fine
every
time
using
Chromium
(I
use
this
for
this
one
application
as
a
work-around).
I
think
Ubiquiti
designs
for
Chrome.
For
more
info
here
is
the
thread
I
posted
on
their
site
https://community.ubnt.com/t5/EdgeMAX/GUI-slow-to-load-login-page-in-Firefox/td-p/2024949
I
followed
the
instructions
here

I
hope
you
can
help
me
out.
Getting
Rid
of
Bookmarks
Dropdown
Menu
Hello,
I
just
updated
to
Firefox
version
55.0.2,
and
I
would
like
to
know
how
to
get
rid
of
the
dropdown
menu
in
the
bookmarks
sidebar,
as
shown
in
the
screenshot.
Not
only
do
I
not
need
it
or
see
why
it
is
needed
(one
can
access
History
and
Synced
Tabs
from
the
Menu
Bar),
but
if
I
click
on
a
link
at
the
very
bottom
of
the
links
visible
(in
my
case,
the
link
labeled
as
'Hours
&
Directions'
with
the
Mazda
logo),
it
'skips'
to
the
link
below
it,
and
makes
me
click
on
that
link
instead.
While
scrolling
down
a
few
clicks
is
not
much
effort
at
all,
it's
something
that
I
did
not
have
to
do,
and
something
I
feel
I
should
not
have
to
do
to
simply
properly
click
a
link.
Is
there
a
way
to
get
rid
of
the
dropdown
menu
in
the
bookmarks
bar?
Since
the
update
to
Firefox
55
my
extensions
are
all
weird,
some
don't
work,
and
tabs
are
not
restored
Since
the
update
to
FF
55
my
tab
sessions
do
not
restore,
and
my
Gmail
Notifier

extention
doesn't
show
up
on
my
toolbar,
nor
can
I
find
it
anywhere
to
add
it.
Are
there
newer
versions
of
extensions?
How
do
I
update
and/or
fix
this?
I
see
Legacy
next
to
all
of
my
extensions.
What
does
this
mean?
Somewhere
someone
should
have
posted
explanations
of
all
this
-
if
they
did
I
can't
find
them.
I'm
a
long
term
FF
user
but
this
has
me
stumped.
When
I
go
to
my
gmail
everything
is
askew.
I've
tried
refreshing
but
nothing
helps
and
words
are
cut
off
within
their
boxes
or
not
positioned
correctly.
I've
looked
at
my
gmail
through
Safari
and
everything
looks
fine
so
it's
definitely
firefox.
I
tried
downloading
the
newest
version
on
my
computer
and
refreshed
but
nothing
changed
and
the
'compose'
box
is
half
chopped
off
and
when
I
write
an
email
the
recipient's
email
address
is
chopped
off.
The
boxes
that
say
Primary,
Social
and
Promotions
is
also
chopped
off
at
the
bottom
of
the
words.

Realtor
map
does
not
render
in
FF,
but
does
in
IE.
How
can
I
fix?
For
some
reason,
the
Realtor.ca
website
won't
load
maps.
All
it
shows
is
'Sorry
we
have
no
imagery
here'
(see
screen
shot).
Yet,
the
maps
show
up
fine
in
Internet
Explorer,
no
problem
there.
There
seems
to
be
a
disconnect
with
FF
and
(I
assume)
Google
Maps.
I
like
using
FF,
but
I'm
trying
to
find
a
property
and
this
problem
isn't
going
away
on
its
own.
Can
somebody
please
help
me
figure
this
out?
Thanks
in
advance.

a

How/where
can
I
install
Firefox
version
52.0
?
As
I
understand
it
from
browsing
Mozilla
Firefox
sites,
with
my
Windows
XP
operating
system
I
cannot
upgrade
newer
that
Firefox
version
52.0.
All
Mozilla
Firefox
upgrades
I've
tried
downloading
are
newer
than
this.
How
and
where
can
I
download
the
Firefox
version
I
need?
When
I
go
to
any
Mozilla
site,
I'm
directed
only
to
the
download
of
the
latest
version,
which
Mozilla
states
is
compatible
only
with
Windows
7
and
newer;
I'm
not
understanding
why
Mozilla
has
no
provision
for
downloading
the
Firefox
version
they
recommend
my
using
for
the
operating
system
I
have,
and
which
they
recommend.
Why
is
text
history
not
persistent
between
tabs
anymore?
I
used
to
be
able
to
open
a
new
tab,
press
ctrl+Z,
and
have
the
same
address
(or
random
text,
didn't
matter)
of
the
tab
I
was
just
in
placed
into
the
new
tab
as
well.
I
could
modify
it
a
bit
and
navigate
to
another
similar
page,
or
duplicate
the
tab
in
a
split
second
if
I
want.
This
was
a
feature
I
used
frequently
and
other
prominent
browsers
don't
do
it.
Why
was
it
removed?
Was
it
an
accident?
I
can't
think
of
a
legitimately
good
reason
such
a
unique
and
unobtrusive
feature
would
be
removed
intentionally.
How
do
I
turn
off
the
'Tip'
bar
that
comes
on
a
blank
page
at
the
top
when
I
click
to
insert
the
cursor
in
the
URL
bar?
When
I
clear
the
page
from
a
tab
or
window
and
then
put
the
cursor
in
to
the
URL
bar,
a
'tip'
bar
shows
up
at
the
top
of
the
window
to
explain
how
to
search.
How
do
I
turn
this
display
of
tips
off????

Hi,
The
question
above,
says
it
all.
For
about
the
last
month,
each
and
every
day,
(every
24
hours)
Firefox
logs
me
out
of
Outlook.com,
despite
me
checking
to
stay
logged
in.
This
doesn't
happen
using
the
MS
Edge
browser
and
I
even
downloaded
Chrome,
just
to
see
if
it
did
there,
but
its
all
OK.
I
hate
Chrome
and
want
my
fantastic
Firefox
to
work
perfectly,
like
it
used
to.
The
only
thing
that
changed
at
about
that
time
was
that
I
updated
to
a
newer
version
of
Bitdefender
free,
which
did
a
few
strange
things
to
my
PC.
Could
this
be
another?
Can
you
help
with
this
please?
Thanks
&
Cheers,

Yesterday,

and
nothing

No

just
nothing.
I
did

on
your

to
try
to

a
solution.
I
find

:

But
even
this
action,
i
don't
succeed.
When
i
write
the
sentence
Applications/Firefox
etc
etc
the
terminal
doesn't
recognize
anything.
What
can
i
do
?
I've

Aurélie
Green
bar
appears
in
video
players,
but
it
only
does
so
in
Firefox.
Hi,
I
seem
to
have
come
across
a
problem
that
only
occurs
in
Firefox:
while
playing
videos
in
basically
any
video
player
(YouTube,
Vimeo,
LiveLeak,)
a
green
bar
/
stripe
appears
either
on
the
bottom
of
the
video
or
at
the
right
hand
side
of
it.
I'm
using
HTML5
for
playback,
and
the
green
bar
does
not
appear
while
I
switch
to
flash
player.
Like
I've
mentioned
it
only
appears
in
Firefox:
I've
tried
using
Internet
Explorer
and
suprisingly
enough,
no
green
bar
there
(IE
also
using
HTML5
for
playback.)
Most
of
online
solutions
to
this
problem
mention
switching
the
hardware
acceleration
off,
but
I'm
using
HTML5
so
there
is
no
option
to
do
so
in
the
player,
and
disabling
it
in
Firefox
doesn't
seem
to
help
at
all.
I'm
pretty
sure
my
video
card
drivers
are
up
to
date
along
with
any
other
software
that
is
involved
in
playback.
I'm
not
sure
what
to
do
now.
The
better
the
quality
of
the
video
the
smaller
the
stripe
gets
but
it's
still
pretty
annoying
and
I
want
to
get
rid
of
it.
Thanks
in
advance.

updated

Firefox
and
Firefox
Developer
edition
won't
start/Crash
at
startup
Hello
there.
I'm
using
Mac
OS
Sierra
10.12.6
This
morning
I
updated
Firefox
to
the
latest
update
and
since
then
it
stopped
working.
Whenever
I
click
on
the
icon
nothing
happens.
A
similar
thing
happened
to
Firefox
Developer
Edition
a
few
months
ago
and
since
then
I
switched
to
the
normal
edition
of
Firefox.
I
trie
uninstalling
and
installing
again.
I
tried
deleting
my
profiles
and
making
new
profiles.
I
deleted
all
related
files
and
installed
Firefox
again
and
nothing
worked.
This
issue
is
for
both
versions
of
Firefox.
The
only
way
I
can
get
Firefox
or
Firefox
Developer
Edition
to
run
is
to
run
the
profile
manager,
delete
all
existing
profiles
and
create
new
one.
After
doing
that
Firefox
will
run,
but
if
I
close
Firefox
and
open
again
it
won't
open.
Thanks
in
advance
for
the
replies
and
suggestions.
I
hope
I
can
find
a
solution
soon.
Life
is
hard
without
the
Firefox
Dev
tools.

FF
Updated
to
55.0.2.
Last
Pass
Extension
will
not
Open.
Works
in
IE
I
have
downloaded
and
installed
the
Last
Pass
extension
yet
it
will
NOT
open
after
the
55.0.2.update.
It
does
open
in
Internet
Explorer
so
it's
definitely
a
Firefox
issue.
How
can
I
get
Last
Pass
to
open?
After
upgrading
from
54.0.1
to
55.0.2
-
Firefox
will
not
open
We
are
using
the
standalone
installer
to
upgrade
our
fleet
from
54.0.1
to
55.0.2
and
after
the
install
Firefox
will
not
load.
It
shows
up
in
Task
Manager
processes,
but
the
window
doesn't
actually
open.
I
have
tried
55.0,
55.0.1,
and
55.0.2
-
none
of
them
work.
I
even
tried
going
to
Help-About-Update,
the
same
thing
happens.
How
do
I
enable
Adobe?
So
I
have
read
about
the
update
to
Firefox
and
that
some
plug
ins
were
removed
but
it
says
Adobe
is
still
available
however
I
cant
find
it.
My
school
says
that
Firefox
is
the
better
browser
to
use
and
that
it
supports
the
Adobe
Flash
player
but
I
cant
seem
to
figure
out
how
to
make
it
work.
'Saving
GIF
using
Firefox'
How
do
I
save
a
gif
using
Firefox?
On
Macbook
(El
Capitan
10.11.16),
Firefox
already
installed,opens
on
boot
no
issue,
but
window
opens
to
add
to
apps
and
tries
to
open
it
again.
How
stop
that?
Happens
every
time
I
boot.
The
window
that
pops
up
is
the
one
with
the
Firefox
icon,
a
right
arrow,
then
the
applications
icon.
I
moved
it
there
successfully
when
first
installed.
Why
does
it
keep
asking
me
to
do
it
again
when
Firefox
is
already
open
successfully
and
sitting
in
my
dock?
I
can
just
delete
it
and
continue
on
fine,
but
it's
very
annoying.
If
I
do
what
it
says
to
try
to
appease
it
and
make
it
go
away,
it
will
add
a
second
Firefox
in
my
apps
then
try
to
open
it
again
and
fail
b/c
it's
already
open.
Frustrating
and
annoying,
no
lethal.

FireFox
blocking
Fake
News;
does
that
mean
CNN,

Whoever
is
pressuring
FireFox
to
block
the
Alternative
Media
is
NOT
a
friend
to
freedom
of
the
press.
I
suspect
that
have
something
incriminating
about
the
leadership;
it
doesn't
make
sense.
If
you
pull
this
shit,
I
will
leave
FireFox
forever.
All
truth
passes
through
three
stages.
First,
it
is
ridiculed.
Second,
it
is
violently
opposed.
(WE
ARE
HERE,
FIREFOX
WHERE
ARE
YOU?)
Third,
it
is
accepted
as
being
self-evident.

I

It
is
happening
on

systems.
I
installed
the

yesterday.
I
am
guessing
some
part
of
that
package
is
causing
the
problem.
I
don't
want
to
uninstall
it,
because
I
need
it
for
a
project
I
am
working
on.
Has
anyone
seen
this
and
knows
where
the
problem
lies?
I
have
tried

Firefox,

that
does
not
fix
the

Hi.
I
haven't
been
on
my
computer
for
around
a
month,
and
when
i
come
back
and
search
something
on
firefox,
it
uses
Yahoo!
as
search
engine.
I
have
set
the
default
search
engine
to
Google,
which
is
my
prefered
search
engine,
but
it
still
uses
Yahoo!
Is
this
because
firefox
has
changed
something,
or
have
i
downloaded
something
that
controls
my
search
engine?
I
have
a
MacBook

running
macOS

of

Thanks!

When
i
watch
a
video
on
any
website,
it
has
color
distortion
and
a
verticle
green
bar
over
it.
When
I
go
on
Firefox
(specifically),
any
video,
whether
it's
an
ad,
or
a
youtube
video
or
something
else,
has
this
vertical
green
bar
over
it
and
a
small
green
bar
across
the
bottom.
The
color
is
also
extremely
distorted.
Colored
parts
of
the
video
appear
in
black
and
white
and
it
looks
like
the
color
that
is
supposed
to
be
there,
is
instead
offset
slightly.
For
example
green
text
would
be
black
and
white,
and
then
a
copy
of
the
same
text
would
be
offset
but
in
what
seems
like
a
random
color.
If
any
on
you
know
how
to
fix
this
it
would
be
very
much
appreciated.
thanks!

Problems
with

Cursor
doesn't
jump
to
the
catch
word
box
Dear
community,
since
today
I
have
an
minor
but
annoying
issue
with
my
bookmark
settings.
As
soon
as
I
click
on
the
little
star,
the
bookmark
section
opens
and
I
am
able
to
write
down
some
catch
words.
But
until
today
the
cursor
would
directly
jump
into
the
'catch-word'
section.
Since
today
it
jumps
into
the
'name'
section.
So
how
can
I
change
that
again.
I
never
want
to
change
the
webpages
name.
I
rather
want
to
directly
type
in
the
catch
words.
Thanks
for
helping
me
out.

I
can

Problems
after
updated
to
55.0.2
I'm
having
all
sorts
of
problems
after
Firefox
automatically
updated
to
55.0.2
in
Windows
7.
It
wouldn't
run.
It
would
start
the
service
but
would
never
actually
open/launch
the
app.
I
uninstalled
it
and
went
to
the
32bit
d/l
page
to
reinstall.
But,
it
installed
the
64
bit
version
(grrrr).
Now,
the
biggest
problem
I
am
having
is
that
when
I
click
on
a
link
in
an
email
or
office
document,
the
browser
doesn't
launch
or
a
new
tab
open.
Instead,
I
get
an
error
message:
General

The
URL
was:

without
installing

Is
there
any
way
to
keep

being
actually
N,
but
make
it
able
to
play
h.264
in

Why
might
manual

not
find
updates?
I
have
a
Windows
7
64-bit
machine
currently
running
Firefox
55.0.2
(64-bit).
Up
until
yesterday,
it
was
running
54.0.1
(64-bit).
On
this
machine,
I
do
a
manual
'Check

once
a
day
so
I
was
very
surprised
when
55.0.2
showed
up
yesterday
because
'Check
for
updates'
had
never
found
55
(August
8)
or
55.0.1
(August
10).
Is
there
a
reason
(logical
explanation)
for
this?
Were
those
updates
(55,
55.0.1)
possibly
not
released
for
all
configurations?

Firefox

deleted
all
my

It
left
a

how

I

back?
What

does

give?
'Various'
tells
me
nothing.
I
am
running

52.2
on

It

quite
often
when

up.
I
would
like
to
go

BUT
only
if
it

The

nothing,

that

Thanks!
Is
there
anyway
to
bookmark
all
tabs
into
an
existing
folder
without
all
the

tabs
getting
put
into
a

within
the

Example:
I
have
a
folder
titled
'Read
Later'
I
have
some
tabs
open
and
Bookmark
All
Tabs.
All
these
tabs
I
just
bookmarked
then
get
automatically
placed
into
a
new
folder
in
the
'Read

folder.
Anyway
I
can
bookmark
all
the
new
tabs
into
the
'Read
Later'
folder
directly
without
a
new
subfolder
being
created?

Firefox
regards
Logitech
software
as
an
add-on.
It
isn't
I
use
a
Logitech
software
utility
that
came
with
my
Logitech
keyboard
and
mouse
combination.
Firefox
regards
the
Logitech
utility
as
an
add-on
and
has
disabled
part
of
it.
Logitech
is
an
independent
program,
nothing
to
do
with
Firefox.
The
utility
puts
pop-up
notifications
on
the
screen
when
certain
keys
are
pressed,
such
as
the
sound
control
and
caps
key
notification.
These
no
longer
work
despite
installing
the
latest
Logitech
software.
I
have
contacted
Logitech
and
they
have
no
answer.
I
have
been
into
the
about:config
and
changed
the
xpinstall.signatures.required
to
false,
but
the
notifications
are
still
disabled.
This
is
wrong
that
Firefox
is
interfering
with
a
commercial
program
that
is
not
an
add-on
and
has
nothing
to
do
with
Firefox.

Additionally
the

my

is
not

my

This
was
NOT
a
problem
before
upgrading
to
the

(64-bit).
I've
gone
through
my
Web

and
they
can

in
the

After
a
couple
of
hours
today,
they
can
find
no
answer
other
than
there
is
a
problem
with
Firefox.
I
have
uninstalled
Firefox
per
Firefox
instructions
and
then

I
get
the

Carlton
mozglue.dll
and
XPCOM
ok..
so
today
firefox
decided
it
no
longer
wanted
to
work
after
my
computer
updated,
i've
completely
wiped
it
from
my
computer
(laptop,
THANKFULLY
my
desk
top
is
still
working)
and
uninstalled/reinstalled
it
easily
a
dozen
times...
with
either
the
'couldn't
find
XPCOM'
error
or
'mozglue.dll
was
not
found'
error.
i
no
longer
know
what
to
do.
none
of
the
help
pages
are
helping.
i'm
getting
very
frustrated
and
if
there
was
another
browser
out
there
that
wasn't
crap
i'd
switch
over
to
it.
at
this
point
i
dont
even
care
if
i
lose
my
bookmarks
i
jsut
want
to
be
able
to
use
my
stupid
computer
without
the
hassle
of
trying
to
use
chrome
or
opera
or
whatever.
i
LIKE
firefox
but
this
is
getting
stupid.
Add
on
icons
not
showing
next
to
the
search
bar.
So
when
I
turned
on
my
computer
today
I
opened
Firefox,
and
it
updated
like
it
does.
Normally,
this
isn't
an
issue.
When
I
opened
it
up
today,
however,
all
of
my
addons
were
disabled.
I
re-enabled
them,
but
it
didn't
quite
go
back
to
normal.
Normally,
I
keep
the
Adblock
Plus
and
YouTube
HD
addons
to
the
right
of
my
search
bar.
But
for
whatever
reason,
I
just
can't
get
them
to
show
like
they're
supposed
to.
Now,
there's
a
magnifying
glass
on
the
right
part
of
my
search
bar
that
wasn't
there
before,
and
anything
I
put
to
the
right
of
the
search
bar
is
hidden
and
only
accessible
by
clicking
on
the
little
arrow
button
and
finding
it
in
a
context
menu.
I
don't
want
the
arrow
button,
I
want
the
addons
to
be
visible
in
the
pane
next
to
the
search
bar.
And
if
anyone
knows
how
to
get
rid
of
the
magnifying
glass,
that
would
also
be
appreciated.
Also
worth
mentioning
is
that
the
only
addons
I
have
that
affect
UI
are
Classic
Theme
Restorer
and
TabMixPlus.

I'm

v56.0b2.
It's
been
a

since
the
last
time
I
used
the

but
I
needed
to
stop
a
page
to
redirect
me,
so
I
went
to
the
options
and
started
looking
for
that
checkbox.
My
surprise
was
when
I
discovered
that
the
whole
menu
has
changed?
Now
there
are
just
4
tabs
on
the
left
column
(general,
search,
privacy
and

and
FF

The
option
I'm
looking
for
now
isn't
under
any
of
these
tabs,
and
I
couldn't
find
any
related
option
on

page.
Is
there
any
chance
to
reveal
it
back,
or
it's
completely
removed
from
the

is

I
run
Manjaro
on
my

on
my

Firefox
has
this

issue
on
both.

Before
updating
to

55
I
was
able
to
get
around
the
problem
by
launching
Firefox
with
`env
GTK_THEME=Adwaita:light`
(or
maybe
it
was
Ambiance).
Since
the
update,
this
workaround
no

works.

Firefox
55.0.2
update
will
not
restore
previous
session
Yesterday
Firefox
updated
to
version
55.0.2
when
I
started
it.
When
I
then
tried
to
restore
the
previous
session,
it
remembered
the
first
tab
in
the
previous
session
and
none
of
the
others.
I
thought
this
might
be
a
glitch
simply
between
the
two
versions,
but
I
now
see
this
is
not
so.
I
just
logged
off
with
several
tabs
open,
and
when
I
returned
and
selected
'Restore
Previous
Session'
it
again
restored
only
the
first
tab.
In
both
instances
all
of
the
other
tabs
appear
as
just
blank
tabs.
I
am
new
to
these

so
please
forgive
me
if
this
has
been
asked
before.
I
did
do
a
search
and
could
not
find
this
particular

that

(i.e.
archived)
over
the

in
folders
in

have
all

on
how
to
eliminate
the

problem:
I
have
two
desktops
and
a
laptop,
all
using
the
same
Firefox
version.
Two
are
Linux
Mint
18.2,
but
the
main
Firefox
desktop
is
on
Windows
7
Ultimate.
To
clear
out
old
bookmarks
and
create
a
fresh
sync
data,
I
deleted
the
sync
account
and
created
a
new
sync
account
using
the
same
email
account
and
password
as
I
had
before.
All
this
was
done
on
the
same
Windows
desktop
while
the
other
desktops
were
turned
off.
Sync
created
a
new
data
set
as
I
wanted,
(bookmarks,
add-ons,
passwords
and
preferences).
But
the
next
day
it
synced
and
re-added
bookmarks
from
the
old
account,
as
well
as
duplicated
several
hundred
new
bookmarks.
I
don't
know
how
to
avoid
this
problem.
I
zipped
30
small
text
logs
from
the
weave
subfolder,
but
I
cannot
attach
it.

Preferred
Update
Options
in
about:config
If
I
want
to
have
my
firefox
update
to
the
following
standards,
what
about:config
settings
would
I
make/change?
-
Have
firefox
check
for
updates
once
per
day
-
Have
update
attempt
as
soon
as
I
start
Firefox
-
Have
Firefox
notify
me
of
an
available
update
(e.g.
prompt
me
that
update
is
loaded
and
I
need
to
restart)
as
soon
as
possible
There
are
a
variety
of
'update'
settings...just
curious
which
ones
would
enable
above.
Thanks
in
advance.
How
to
disable
backgroung
pre-downloading
?
Firefox
seems
to
start
downloading
files
even
before
i
accept
or
cancel
the
download
dialog.
I
have
a
limited
and
fast
data
plan.
I
often
need
to
check
the
file
size
before
allowing
the
file
download.
In
case
of
cancellation,
the
part
already
downloaded
is
a
total
waste.
How
do
I
disable
this
behavior
?

Hello,
For
a
long
time
I
have
issue
with
video
players
in
Firefox.
Sometimes
everything
is
right,
but
after
time,
every
videos
look
like
on
screenshot.
This
problem
concerns
different
websites
and
appears
only
in
Firefox
(In
Chrome
everything
looks
good).
I
have
latest
GPU
drivers
and
latest
Firefox
version
(problem
was
also
in
older
versions).
I
tried
to
use
new
user
profile
or
reinstall
browser,
but
it
wasn't
resolve
my
problem.
Can
I
do
something
to
resolve
this
problem?

I
am
an
old

I

still

no

supports
MS
newer

so
I
am
transferring
to

In
the
Firefox's

menu
'save

does
the
same
as
'save

in
IE
but
I
find
this
confusing
and
have
difficulty
getting
used
to
it.
To
me
a
link
is
one
thing
and
the
target
is
another.
The
link
points
at
the
target
or
object
but
it
is
not
the
object,
it
is
only
a
pointer.
To
me
the
wording
feels
wrong
and
every
time
I
go
to
use
it
I
have
to
stop
to
think.
I
guess
at
my
old
age
my
neurons
are
just
set
and
lack
adaptability.
To
me
the
link
is
is
the
URI
string

points
at
the
target.
I
want
to
know
if
there
is
an
easy
way
for
me
to
change
the
wording
in
the
Firefox
context

from
'save

Hello,
I
recently
started
using

because
of
the

but
when
I

it
(57.0a1

the
logo
changed
to
the

Is
this
a
bug?
Or
do
I
have
an
option
to
change
it?
The

changed
too,
and
can't
change
it
back
to
the

visited
link
colour
So
apparently
in
about:config
there
is
now
a
standart
layout
for
visited
links.
It
overwrites
the
css
sytels
on
my
website.
I
have
to
explicitly
turn
it
off,
to
not
get
all
my
visited
links
in
a
wrong
colour.
I
would
appreciate
if
you
could
fix
that,
or
tell
me
how
i
can
protect
my
styles
to
have
a
higher
priority
than
the
default
layout.visited.css
.
It
worked
fine
yesterday
though.
Why
is
Firefox
no
longer
prompting
to
select
an
SSL
Certificate?
I
am
using
a
3rd
party
application
to
transfer
client
information
from
one
system
to
a
web
portal.
Once
I
transfer
the
information,
I
click
a
button
in
the
3rd
party
application
which
opens
a
link
to
a
clients
file.
At
this
stage,
FireFox
is
supposed
to
prompt
me
to
select
an
SSL
Certificate.
It
was
doing
so
until
around
mid
June
2017.
I
have
added
the
site
to
the
trusted
sites
within
the
Internet
Options
in
the
control
panel
in
my
pc
and
have
even
tried
setting
the
SSL
Certificate
to
use
'Client
Authentication'.
I
have
tried
many
other
things
to
resolve
this
problem,
however,
including
the
Certificate
chain
and
trust
relationships.
the
problem
still
exists.
The
SSL
Certificate
is
installed
in
FireFox.
I
have
also
encountered
the
same
problem
with
Google
Chrome
and
Internet
Explorer
around
the
same
time.
As
soon
as
I
set
the
Certificate
to
use
'Client
Authentication',
Internet
Explorer
worked,
however,
Google
Chrome
and
Mozilla
FireFox
did
not.
I
would
have
expected
Google
Chrome
to
work
once
Internet
Explorer
started
working
as
they
use
the
same
Certificate
Store.
This
problem
has
occurred
on
a
small
work
network
not
using
a
proxy,
I
have
ensured
the
3rd
party
application
I
use,
plus
the
system
I
am
taking
the
data
from
and
all
3
browsers
have
exceptions
within
the
Firewall
being
Kaspersky
Internet
Security.
I
cannot
see
what
the
problem
is.
As
the
two
browsers
being
Google
Chrome
and
Mozilla
FireFox
are
no
longer
prompting
for
the
SSL
Certificate,
I
now
get
an
error
message
saying
'Client
certificate
must
be
present'.
It's
almost
as
if
the
browsers
are
hitting
cancel
and
not
allowing
the
dialogue
box
to
appear
to
let
me
select
an
SSL
Certificate.
Has
anyone
experienced
this
before
and
if
so,
do
you
know
how
to
fix
this?
Thanks.
Cookies
not
shared
with
Firefox
Dev
Tools?
Or
Firefox
Dev
Tools
needs
logging
in
separately?
I
am
seeing
a
strange
problem
which
I
am
not
sure
the
reasons
behind.
-
Cookies?
Firefox
Dev
Tools?
First
of
all,
I
have
'Never
remember
history'
settings
and
cookies
are
not
carried
forward
to
my
next
session.
I
am
developing
a
website
and
some
of
the
pages
require
log-ins
to
access.
The
user
sessions
are
handled
with
cookies.
For
a
log-in
required
page,
I
log
in
and
everything
shows
up
fine
as
how
it
is
after
I
log
in.
When
I
press
Ctrl-U
,
I
can
see
the
source
of
that
page
as
expected.
However,
when
I
press
F12
to
open
the
Firefox
Dev
Tools,
I
click
on
the
Debugger
tab
and
try
to
see
the
source
code
of
that
logged-in
page.
All
I
can
see,
is
the
source
of
the
page
when
I
have
NOT
logged
in,
i.e.
the
log-in
prompt
page.
I
wonder
if
it
is
because
of
my
'Never
remember
history'
settings
which
makes
the
browser
console
unable
to
access
the
cookies
required
for
the
session.
Or
am
I
not
using
the
Firefox
Dev
Tools
correctly?
I
was
a
FireBug
user
and
I
did
not
have
this
problem
before.
I
only
see
this
problem
after
switching
to
the
Firefox
Dev
Tools.

I
have

I
have
tried

I
cleaned

I

all

I
use
in

one
or
a

of

were
causing

This

not
help.
I
have
also
read
all
the
similar

on

none
were
any
help.
The
problem
isn't
related

either.
It
is
a
browser

problem.
Please
help
me
fix
this.

Why
do
dropdown
boxes
not
work
on
Firefox
but
do
on
Internet
Explorer?
When
searching
a
website
or
on
Moodle,
dropdown
boxes
do
not
open
as
they
should.
This
is
a
new
problem.
you
tube
videos
blocked
on
laptop
and
Ipad
I
have
a
new
Windows
laptop
and
an
Ipad.
Recently
I
observe
that
when
I
try
to
view
a
video
that
it
just
won't
download.
I
used
Firefox
as
my
default
browser,
and
I
see
that
JPG
will
play
but
videos
that
are
in
websites
(like
tutorials)
and
You
Tube
just
won't
play.
The
screen
display
shows
the
start
of
the
video
with
the
little
arrow
in
the
center,
but
the
video
won't
automatically
start
and
when
I
activate
the
download
(click
on
the
arrow
in
the
center
of
the
screen
display
for
the
video)
the
circle
that
shows
it
is
downloading
just
goes
on
and
on
and
the
video
does
not
download
or
play.
Since
this
problem
is
common
to
my
Windows
laptop
and
my
Ipad,
being
different
systems,
the
common
item
is
Firefox
and
I
suspect
that
your
most
recent
software
'upgrade'
is
at
fault.
How
can
I
overcome
this
issue?

Today
I
got

What's
up
with
that?
Firefox
gets
super
slow
after
a
while
of
using
it,
have
to
close
it
every
x
amount
of
time..
It
really
seems
like
some
kind
of
memory
leak...
always
happens,
it
seems
related
to
videos/
youtube,
I
have
currently
nearly
600
tabs
open,
but
I
read
on
a
forum
a
guy
have
1000
tabs
and
it
runs
smooth,
so
something
is
really
wrong..
I
got
a
6600k
overclocked
at
4.5ghz
and
16ghb
of

so
it's
not
the

also
I'm
running
chrome
in
the
same
time,
and
even
when
my
CPU
reaches
nearly
100%
chrome
runs
smooth..
I
have
to
close
it
and
reopen
it
every
time
it's
so
annoying.
Would
be
nice
to
get
some
help..
I
also
tryed
to
disable
all
extensions,
still
had
the
same
problem,
right
now
I
disabled
kaspersky
for
the
browser,
it's
not
helping,
something
is
really

I
tryed
to
do
a

HELL..
I
even
tryed
to
reinstall
it
!!
and
still
got
the

this
point
if
I
can't
figure
this
out
soon
I
will
be
using

better,
and
all
my

and

are

Firefox
went
through
a
period
of
slowing
down
after
continued
use
during
the
day
and
after
the
recent
update
pushed
down,
when
Facebook
is
brought
up,
Firebox
than
crashes.
What
does
this
msg
mean?
TypeError:
bundlePreferences
is
null1715
I
have
been
having
a
lot
of
crashes
so
I
updated
my
Firefox
to
version
54.0.1
(32
bit).
Now
I
get
this
error
msg
when
I
open
Firefox:
TypeError:
bundlePreferences
is
null1715
I
also
put
it
here
as
an
attachment.
I
want
to
know
what
this
means
and
how
to
make
it
go
away.
Thank
you.
I
can
not
download
firebug
to
mozilla
55.0.2
(64-bit).
Any
help
Hi,
I
have
installed
mozilla
on
my
laptop
and
created
shortcut
on
desktop.
I
am
tryiing
to
install
firebug
on
browser
but
non
capatible
with
new
browser
55.0.2
(64-bit).
Please
advice.
Thanks
Colors
inconsistent/inaccurate
Weirdest
thing.
Suddenly
noticed
that
colors
are
displaying
incorrectly
in
Firefox
(and
Chrome
FWIW)
but
fine
in
Microsoft
Edge
and
other
apps
like
Corel
where
created.
Screen
cap
is
attached.
Firefox
display
on
the
left,
Edge
display
on
the
right.
Might
be
hard
to
see
on
another
monitor
but
using
something
like
colorcop
(colorcop.net)
you'll
note
how
the
solid
blue
areas
in
Chrome
are
more
purple
than
they
should
be.
To
be
exact,
blue
in
Firefox
is
hex
#25107E.
In
Edge
it
is
#121D82
which
is
what
it
should
be.
Any
help
or
advice
would
be
greatly
appreciated.
Regards.
After
upgrade
to
55.0.2
the
browser
window
is
unresponsive
The
browser
window
opens
my
usual
home
page.
When
I
click
on
the
box
to
type
in
a
new
address,
the
window
image
shifts
up
about
1/8th
inch
almost
cutting
off
the
red
yellow
and
green
dots
on
the
upper
left.
I
can't
click
them.
I
can't
click
and
get
the
cursor
to
work.
I
had
4
add
ons,
but
I
removed
them,
which
took
about
30
seconds
each
-
but
they
are
gone.
I
restarted
twice
and
the
the
browser
window
is
still
unusable.
Nothing
changed.
Half
the
time
when
I
click
in
the
box
to
go
to
a
site
it
loads
youTube,
which
works
fine,
but
I
can't
leave
youTube.
Very
strange.
I
am

an
early
2009
Mac
Pro
with

Quad
Core
Intel
Xeon
processor
OS
10.11.6
I
never
had
any
problem
before
until
the
55.0.2
upgrade.
Can
I
get
the
earlier
version
to
find
out
if
that
is
the
problem?
I
am
writing
this
using
Safari
which
is
having
no

Why

Hi,
I'm
running
an
Ubuntu
16.04,
have
updated
the
'browser.sessionstore.interval'
to
30000.
I
read
that
root
being
owner
of
the
firefox
directory
was
causing
this,
I
ran
$
sudo
chown
-R
$USER:$USER
/usr/bin/firefox
and
my
user
is
currently
the
owner
of
the
stock
ffox
version
directory
and
the
developer
edition
directory
(I
installed
it
with
the
Ubuntu
Make
method,
as
seen
from
the
askubuntu
thread)
Any
input
would
be
highly
appreciated.

and
would
like
to
download
Firefox

[because
I
think
newer
versions
of

won't
work
with

So
can
I
do
this?
I
really
do
not
want
to
'upgrade'!
Thank
you.
Under
AOL
in
Firefox,
SOME
graphics
will
not
display.
Fix:
how?
In
AOL
mail,
when
I
open
SOME
emails,
graphics
will
not
display;
all
I
get
are
empty
frames
with
a
broken
file
icon
in
upper
left
corner.
This
does
not
happen
on
my
other
Mac
computers,
just
my
Macbook
Pro
laptop.
In
contacting
AOL
support,
they
looked
everywhere
they
could
and
suggested
that
Firefox's
'permissions'
might
be
the
problem
and
that
nothing
in
permissions
could
be
changed,
so
they
asked
me
to
go
to
Mozilla
because
nothing
in
AOL
was
able
to
solve
the
problem.

If

will
they

if
I

My

got
messed
up
after
I
allowed
a

which
I
should
not
have
done.
Now,

is
not
up

and

issue.
Firefox
and
IE
work
fine
and
I
can
send
and
receive
emails.
Big
deal!
So,
If
I
wipe
everything
out
and
recover
from
scratch,
can
I
get
Firefox
bookmarks
back
after
I
reinstall
Firefox
all
over
again.
It's
over
a
year's
worth
of
bookmarks
and
I
can't
lose
them!
PC
won't
refresh
either.
Plus,
how
do
I
keep
all
my
document,
download
and
picture
files.
I
must
have
all
of
them
as
well
-
that's
3

Can
anyone
help
a
guy
about
to
turn

in

Or
should
I
take
my
PC
to
a
local
computer
repair
store?
I
did
that
twice
already
and
their
free
diagnostics
proved
nothing
and
the
guys
knew
nothing.
So
would
their
techs
do
any
better?
I
don't
know
if
they
would.
I
thought
these

are
supposed
to
smart.

Tabs
drag
and
drop
is
not
working
Hi,
After
the
last
update
i
noticed
that
i
can't
sort
my
tabs
by
dragging
and
dropping
them
anymore..
My
firefox
version
is
55.0.2
,
So
is
there
any
fix
for
this
issue?
I'm
switching
to
CHROME
if
I
can't
get
My
XMARKS
transferred..
Had
to
reinstall
my
10
OS
and
Firefox
updated
to
new
browser
and
Now
XMARKS
is
VERBOTEN..
What's
sup
with
this
constant
change
crap.
How
do
I
get
them
back.
All
my
10
years
of
bookmarks
are
gone...pissed...
Firefox
accidentally
'restored
to
default
settings'
during
force-close.
Personal
settings
and
history
disappeared...
(Linux
Mint)
Firefox
accidentally
'restored
to
default
settings'
when
closed
forcefully
(~
$
killall),
after
the
application
was
going
slow
and
blocking,
presumably
due
to
system
memory
saturation.
When
I
re-launched
it,
it
appeared
as
if
'restored
to
default
settings',
indeed,
as
when
the
OS
was
newly
installed.
BTW
I
currently
use
Linux
Mint,
which
is
a
development
fork
of
Ubuntu,
using
Ubuntu
repositories.
All
my
preferences,
open
tabs,
bookmarks,
cached
browsing
history,
passwords,
add-ons,
etc.
are
GONE.
The
files
where
some
of
these
were
can
no
longer
be
found
in
~/.mozilla/firefox.
They've
been
rewritten
during
the
event
and
no
older
versions
appear
to
be
kept.
Somehow,
during
the
forceful
shutting
down,
Firefox
was
'restored
to
default
setting'.
Does
anyone
have
a
solution
for
this
anomaly?
(At
least
I
can
recover
my
bookmarks
and
passwords
from
backups,
like
I
would
do
when
migrating
from
one
machine
to
its
successor,
but
I'd
like
to
retrieve
my
open
tabs
and
browsing
history,
add-ons
etc.,
as
I
had
them!)
Thanks...
:-)

The

menu

not

as
I
would
like.
I've
looked
at
the
suggestions
on
the
way
here,
and
none
of
them
really
address
when
I
think
is
my
'complaint'.
See
attached.
When
I
open
the
bookmark
menu,
I
want
MY
stuff
at/near
the
top.
I
am
sure
in
older
versions
I
could
move
the
two
FOLDER
names
further
up
towards
the
top
of
the
menu.
They
are
where
they
are
(shown
in
RED)
and
I
would
like
them
up
near
where
the
GREEN
arrow
is
pointing.
If
I
TRY
to
move
them
there,
they
get
put
in
to
another
folder
and
I
have
to
play
'chasey'
to
find
them
and
where
they
are.
Say
just
under
'recently
bookmarked'.
The
idea
of
a
bookmark
system
is
that
the
sites
you
go
to
a
lot
are
THERE,
quickly
and
easily
got
to.
Not
having
to
open
the
menu,
and
then
scroll
to
the
bottom
to
get
to
the
most
used
sites.
Anyone
know
how
to
get
them
where
I
mentioned?

Where
did
the
content
of
my
status
bar
go
in
FF
55.0.2?
I
am
using
the
add-on
Status-4-Evar
and
I
am
quite
fond
of
it.
This
is
where
I
put
my
calendar
and
weather
add-ons.
Since
updating
to
Firefox
55.0.2.,
the
Status
Bar
is
still
there,
but
empty.
All
my
add-ons
have
disappeared.
They
are
listed
as
updated
in
my
add-ons
list
(with
a
yellow
'LEGACY'
sign,
whatever
that
means).
How
can
I
get
them
back
to
my
Status

Thank
you!

Question
is
rhetorical
Firefox
55
-
Very
low
WebGL
framerate/performance
Here's
a
small
clip
illustrating
it
(please
give
it
a
look):
https://gfycat.com/WetPointedAngora
Edit:
Another
one
demonstrating
it
much
better:
https://gfycat.com/MelodicCourageousBighorn
The
curious
thing
is
that
the
site's
framerate
counter
shows
similarly
high
values
on
both,
but
the
framerate
is
visibly
way
worse
on
Firefox.
Tested
against
Chrome,
both
using
the
same
GPU
and
similar
Add-Ons
and
open
tabs.
Multiprocess
is
enabled.
The
issue
also
happens
when
tested
individually
and
also
with
all
add-ons
disabled.
That
is
not
the
only
website
with
the
problem,
it
also
happens
on

pretty
much
anything
that
uses

Checked

i

1)

2)
On
the
plugins
page,
i
see
that
firefox
is
asking
for
the
second
shockwave
flash
21.0
to
be
updated.
But
it
looks
like
i
already
have
the
26.0
version
installed.
Anyways,
i
still
tried
updating
flash
many
times,
closed
browsers
and
restarted
but
this
still
says
that
it
is
outdated.
Not
sure
if
this
is
the
issue.
Please
help
me
fix
this
issue
as
i
cannot
use
firefox.
I
do
like

and
want
to
use
it
again.

YouTube
Livestreams
freezing
all
over
again
Whenever
I
try
to
watch
a
livestream
on
YouTube
it
usually
takes
only
a
few
minutes
and
the
stream
will
get
stuck
loading.
Once
that
happens
I
always
have
to
manually
refresh
the
page
or
it
will
never
finish
loading.
This
is
NOT
an
issue
with
my
internet
connection
or
anything
like
that
because
I
only
have
this
problem
in
firefox
and
no
other
browser.
I
already
disabled
all
plugins
I
had
installed
but
the
problem
still
occurs.
How
can
I
fix
this
issue?
youtube
videos
have
dual
audio
streams,
still
play
in
Moz
Safe
Mode
When
I
play
youtube
videos,
there
is
a
dual
audio
track
that
can't
be
shut
down,
turned
off,
or
volume
controled.
It
plays
in
sync
sometimes,
but
mostly
starts
late
and
sounds
like
an
echo
or
worse!
I
have
tried
opening
Firefox
in
safe
mode
but
it
does
not
solve
the
problem.
So
far
it
only
happens
with
Youtube
videos.
I
don't
know
if
it's
a
Mozilla
or
youtube
issue.
There
is
also
a
small
black
'speaker
cone'
icon
it
the
right-hand
side
of
the
page-tab.
If
I
click
on
it
a
strike
thru
line
appeard
over
the
icon
to
indicate
it's
been
shut
off.
But
it
also
closes
down
the
other
audio
stream
so
there
is
NO
audio
at
all!
How
do
I
fix
this?

Unable

When
I
attempt
to
make
a
comment
on
Youtube
(may
affect
other
sites,
haven't
tried),
I
get
a
red
error
statement
that
says
'Unknown
error.'
that's
all
it
says
and
the
comment
refuses
to
load.
Out
of
frustration,
I
started
doing
'morse

on
my
mouse
button,
so
after
about
200
or
300
clicks,
the
comment
suddenly
posted
to

I
have
to
do
this
for
each
and
every

It
seems
(not

if
this

is
true
or
not)
that
I
need
to

What
could
be
clearing
Firefox
Cache?
I'm
accessing
a
remote
desktop
Windows
server.
I
have
installed
Firefox
Portable.
When
I
login
to
the
site
I
reach
two-factor
authentication.
I've
authenticated
it
manually
and
ticked
the
box
'Don't
ask
for
codes
on
this
device'.
Each
time
I
relaunch
Firefox
it
works
without
having
to
reauthenticate,
but
each
time
I
close
the
remote
connection
and
reconnect,
the
Firefox
cache
appears
to
have
cleared
and
I
have
to
go
through
2
factor
authentication
again.
Have
you
any
idea
why
the
cache
would
be
clearing?
I
sometimes
run
CCleaner
manually
but
even
when
I
do
that,
I
can
still
login
without
2-factor,
so
I
don't
think
it
is
ccleaner
causing
the
problem.
I
think
it
is
something
to
do
with
reconnecting
to
the
server.

some

Firefox

Update
Ready

A
security
and
stability
update
for
Firefox
has
been
downloaded
and
is
ready
to
be
installed.
Update:
Firefox
55.0.2
The
update
will
be
installed
the
next
time
Firefox
starts.
You
can
restart
Firefox
now,
or
continue
working
and
restart
later.
I
click
the
[Restart
Firefox]
button,
Firefox
quits
and
restarts,
and
the
window
appears
again;
the
update
has
never
been
installed.
I
don't
particularly
mind
going
and
getting
the
new
Firefox
from
the
download
site
(though
there's
no
link
to
it
in
the
Bookmarks,
so
I
have
to
search
it
out),
but
I'm
guessing
it
has
already
been
downloaded
and
is
hidden
somewhere.
No
sense
is
having
two
copies
of
the
application
on
my
Mac;
so
if
I
update
manually
I'd
like
to
delete
the
downloaded
one.
Or
use
it
for
the
update
manually,
since
it
won't
work
automatically.
So
where
is
it?

Why
is
my
Firefox
being
blocked
for
'Adult'
content?
Many
websites
that
I
regularly
visited
(some
adult
sites,
some
anime,
some
Hentai)
are
now
content
blocked
and
Firefox
says
it
can't
find
them.
How
can
I
unblock,
or
change
the
content
of
Firefox?
The
regular
stuff
doesn't
do
it.
How
do
i
get
rid
of

Its

I
move

can't

Can't
load
local
flash
files
in
firefox
Up
until
a
week
or
so
ago,
I
was
able
to
run
locally
saved
flash
files
through
firefox
on
my
computer.
Open
folder
on
desktop,
run..
'stupid
game.swf'.
Play
for
a
while,
shut
down,
go
on
with
day.
Worked
for
months.
Just
a
couple
days
ago,
after
not
messing
around
with
'stupid
game'..
I
tried
to
open
it..
and
firefox
comes
up
'white
screen'..
not
working,
where
it
was
working
just
a
week
or
so
ago.
Try
I.E...
it
loads
there.
Youtube
works..
websites
with
embedded
flash
(kongregate,
etc)..
work
fine.
Just,
firefox
itself
doesn't
seem
to
like
local
flash.
Have
fixed
issues
like
this
in
the
past
of
deleting
the
file
'mimetypes'
from
my
profile..
but,
I
dont
seem
to
have
one.
I've
right
clicked
the
.swf
in
my
computer..
and
it
shows
IE
as
acceptable..
but
doesn't
show
firefox.
Heck
when
I
say
'add
program'
and
browse
to
firefox
and
try
to
add
it
that
way,
it
doesn't
show
up.

Does

have
a
fix
or
vulnerability
for
844-335-1180
security
scam?
I
received
scary
scammer
phone
call
today
saying
to
call
that
number
and
get
my
network
scanned
before
using
the
internet.
I
didn't
but
the
extensive
information
about
the
scam
listed
on
reportthecall.com
leads
me
to
wonder
if
they
have
not
already
accessed
my
computer
through
my
use
of
Firefox.
the
Adobe
Flash
Player
update
keeps
saying:
We've

Youtube
videos
will
not
play
on
other
websites
Hello
Ok.
So
I
have
a
pretty
specific
problem,
which
only
happens
on
Firefox
and
not
other
browsers
that
I
have
on
my
computer.
Basically,
Youtube
videos
will
not
play
on
any
website,
other
than
Youtube.
For
example,
if
I
go
to
youtube.com,
I
can
play
any
video
without
any
issues.
However,
if
someone
put
a
youtube
video
on
another
website
(for
example,
twitter
or
9gag.tv)
then
I
cant
play
them.
I
dont
get
an
error
message
or
anything.
Just
an
empty
space
where
the
video
box
should
be
(see
attachments).
Did
anyone
ever
had
this
issue
before?
The
only
addons
that
I
have
are
adblock
plus,
but
i
believe
the
issue
was
present
even
before
I
installed
this,
and
disabling/removing
it
does
not
solve
the
issue.

for
examples.
I
wish
to
remove
the
box
where
it
comes
up
with

engines
as
I
find
this
feature
annoying.

Issue
playing
videos
at
360p
in
Firefox
55.0.2.
I've
had
an
issue
with
Firefox
that
I've
noticed
only
since
I
updated
to
Firefox
55.
I've
noticed
that
when
a
video
is
played
at
360p
(whether
it's
on
YouTube,
Vimeo,
or
wherever),
the
color
becomes
completely
distorted
and
a
large
vertical
green
bar
appears
in
the
center-left
part
of
the
video.
I
change
a
lot
of
the
internal
settings
in
Firefox
to
personalize
it,
but
I've
never
experienced
this
issue.
I
decided
I
would
look
into
it
and
try
to
troubleshoot
it
myself
before
coming
here,
and
here's
what
I've
gathered
so
far:
1.
This
does
not
occur
on
any
other
browser,
nor
does
it
occur
on
any
other
quality
setting
(e.g.
480p).
2.
The
issue
is
not
caused
by
any
of
my
add-ons,
as
I've
disabled
all
of
them
and
it
still
happens
whenever
I
set
the
quality
of
a
video
to
360p.
3.
The
only
thing
that
has
successfully
prevented
the
issue
is
Safe
Mode,
but
I
have
no
idea
what
it
is
about
Safe
Mode
that
causes
the
video
to
go
back
to
normal.
4.
I've
refreshed
Firefox
about
3
times,
and
each
time,
I
tested
it
before
and
after
I
restored
my
add-ons
and
settings,
and
it
worked
fine,
but
the
next
time
I
would
start
Firefox,
it
would
start
occurring
again.
I've
basically
come
here
as
a
last
resort.
I
believe
it's
one
of
my
settings
that
causes
this,
but
I
have
no
idea
which
one.
I've
tried
reversing
a
bunch
of
them
to
see
what
was
causing
it,
but
with
no
permanent
solutions.
Any
ideas?
How
can
I
disable
the
DRM
nag?
I'm
not
the
most
trusting
person...
I'll
not
allow
DRM.
How
can
I
be
rid
of
the
nag?

Hi,
i
got
a
problem
with
the
new
update
of
my
firefox,
everytime
I
click
the
new
tab
after
the
first
tab
it
just
keeps
on
loading
and
loading,
it
doesnt
redirect
to
the

and
only
the

I
was

use.
I
tried
looking

but
I
can't
find
it.
Firefox
crashes

for
some
reason
my
tabs
just
keep
crashing
for
no
reason
even
in
safe

I
scan

viruses
and
nothing
came
up,I
even
did
a

install.
And
it
still
gives
me
grief
any
help
would
be
appreciated.

Firefox
doesn't
remember
window
sizes
or
positions
I
know
there
are
a
variety
of
solutions
posted
here
to
this
problem
(like
deleting
xulstore)
but
Firefox
recently
(v55?)
stopped
remembering
my
window
sizes
and
positions
on
restore.
I
thought
it
was
an
add-on
problem
like
Classic
Theme
Restorer
or
SessionManager
or
TabMixPlus
but
I
tried
with
a
brand
new
profile
with
no
add-ons
installed
and
it
still
is
displaying
the
same
broken
behaviour:
all
restored
windows
are
restored
to
the
same
stock
size
and
position
and
new
windows
open
with
that
same
stock
size
also
(even
if
they
are
opened
from
windows
whose
size
I
have
changed).
Anyone
know
what
is
going
on?
Is
this
a
recent
regression?
When
I
open
Firefox
on
my
PC
I
get
a
website
that
says
myway.com
online
form
finder
instead
of
my
usual
firefox
with
a
google
search
bar.
It
is
taking
my
computer
forever
to
open
Firefox
because
it
is
opening
with
a
website
called
myway.com
and
it
is
in
some
kind
of
online
form
finder.
Instead
of
the
box
being
Google,
it
is
a
box
that
on
the
right
side
outside
the
box
it
says
Powered
by
Google
and
on
the
left
side
outside
the
box,
it
has
a
small
multicolored
lined
circle.
During
one
of
my
searches
today,
I
think
I
used
a
form
finder
and
now
it
seems
to
be
defaulting
to
this
site
which
is
not
secure.

Sound

on

works
fine
on

Hi
folks,
I
often
visit
afl.com.au
to
listen
to
broadcast
of
matches.
Just
this
weekend
it
has
stopped
working.
Still
works
fine
in
Chrome,
so
I
assume
my
problem
is
with
Firefox.
Any
assistance
greatly
appreciated.
Firefox
completely
blanks
out
all
screens
on
all
tabs
forcing
me
to
shut
it
down
Things
were
fine
until
a
couple
months
ago.
Now
I
can't
use
Firefox
without
the
entire
window
blanking
out.
And
not
just
the
tab
I'm
currently
working
in,
but
ALL
tabs.
Things
I
was
commenting
on,
surveys
I
was
taking,
emails
I
was
responding
to,
EVERYTHING
gets
wiped
out.
I
have
no
choice
but
to
completely
shut
down
Firefox
Then
I
restart
it,
and
it
works
ok
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
totally
blanks
out
again.
In
fact,
I'm
surprised
I
was
able
to
make
this
whole
post
without
the
White
Screen
of
Death.
FYI,
I've
run
all
antivirus
and
ensured
no
errors
or
issues
that
need
resolved.
I've
cleared
my
browsing
history
and
cache
and
that
doesn't
work.
The
'safe
mode'
doesn't
work
because
then
I
can't
do
what
I
need
to
do.
I've
refreshed
Firefox
so
many
times,
it's
ridiculous
and
then
I
lose
all
my
bookmarks,
add-ons,
and
history.
I
have
found
51
instances
of
old
Mozilla
Firefox
installed
in
other
program
folders
My
current
Firefox
version
is
55.0.2
(64-bit)
which
I
went
to
because
of
Flash
issues
etc
etc
with
the
32-bit.
In
the
meantime,
while
looking
for
the
current
version
folder,
I
have
discovered
over
50
old
working
instances
of
'Mozilla
Firefox'
'hidden'
in
other
program
folders.
A
few
examples
are:
C:\\Program
Files
(x86)\\dictionaries\\Mozilla
Firefox
C:\\Program
Files
(x86)\\AoaoPhoto
Digital
Studio\\Mozilla
Firefox\\browser\\Mozilla
Firefox
C:\\wifidata\\Mozilla
Firefox\\Mozilla
Firefox
(3)\\Program
Files
(x86)\\Mozilla
Firefox\\dictionaries\\Mozilla
Firefox
The
list
goes
on
&
on.
My
hard
drive
is
big,
but
something
has
to
be
done
about
all
these
'rogue'
instances
of
Firefox.
They
are
all
32-bit
by
the
way.
I
have
opened
some
of
them
and
they
immediately
begin
to
'upgrade'
to
a
newer
version
because
they
have
been
sitting
unused
for
a
long
time.
How
on
earth
can
I
delete
this
clutter?
Please

high
CPU
usage
on
MacOS
10.12.6,
especially
with
embedded
video
I'm
trying
to
troubleshoot
some
issues
on
my
late
2013
MacBook
Pro.
Most
notably,
the
performance
seems
to
be
absolutely
awful
with
embedded
HTML5
videos.
For
example:
https://twitter.com/CNET/status/897900931861413888
Letting
this
video
play
almost
immediately
pegs
my
CPU
to
the
point
that
it
actually
starts
skipping.
The
same
video
under
Safari
and
Chrome
plays
fine
and
barely
taps
the
CPU
at
all.
I've
tried
every
version
over
54,
and
this
issue
is
being
replicated
with
a
brand
new
profile
and
zero
extensions
installed.
It
does
it
even
on
the
latest
nightly
build
as
of
today
(8/19/17).
Any
suggestions
would
be
appreciated!

Just

my

At
first,
they
were

just

my

But
suddenly,
they

I

Printing
in
firefox
not
working
right
Whenever
I
try
to
print
pretty
much
anything
--
Paypal
invoices,
shipping
labels,
etsy
invoices,
a
webpage,
pdfs,
etc
--
firefox
prints
it
wrong,
usually
misaligned
and
cutoff
on
multiple
sides,
as
well
as
incorrect
fonts
and
font
sizes.
The
only
thing
I've
tried
doing
so
far
is
turning
off:
print.extend_native_print_dialog;false
and
turning
the
margins
for
my
printer
to
0,
but
that
didn't
help,
just
made
it
worse.
Stuff
was
still
cut
off,
but
this
time
it
extended
to
the
edges
of
the
pages.
What
can
I
do?
Firefox
loads
pages
at
bottom
Hi,
ever
since
the
latest
update,
when
Firefox
loads
long
pages,
it
scrolls
to
the
bottom
of
them
automatically.
I've
tried
starting
with
safe
mode
with
all
extensions
off,
as
well
as
turning
carat
mode
(f7)
off
and
on
and
off
again.
None
of
it
works
and
it's
frustrating.
Thanks.
How
to
edit
statuspanel
css?
I
want
to
edit
the
background
and
the
text
color
of
the
Firefox's
statuspanel
(the
little
tooltip
that
shows
in
the
left
corner).
I've
used
the
following
code
in
userChrome.css:
@namespace
url('http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul');
statuspanel
{
color:
#ff0000;
background-color:
#0000ff;
}
But
the
text
color
doesn't
change,
while
the
background-color
fill
an
empty
limited
space
around
the
statuspanel,
and
not
the
statuspanel's
background.

How

Before

I
copied
the

Afetr
installing

and
re-installing
Firefox,
I
copied
the

back
into

thinking
the

would
bring

my

It
didn't.

Hi,
Recently,
I
have
been
unable
to
watch
some
youtube
videos.
The
infamous
message
'An
error
occured,
please
try
again
later.'
appears.
I
tried
to
watch
the
same
video
with
Internet
Explorer
and
it
worked
just
fine,
which
means
this
problem
happens
because
of
Firefox.
As
many
have
suggested,
I
have
tried
deleting
all
of
my
cookies
and
changing
my
DNS
and,
unlike
most
people
facing
this
problem,
it
didn't
work.
When
reinstalling
Firefox
I
was
surprised
to
see
that
the
problem
had
disappeared...
before
coming
back
once
I
had
deleted
my
browsing
history
and
closed
Firefox.
I
would
really
be
grateful
if
someone
would
help
me
solve
this
problem
as
I
really
don't
want
to
switch
to
Chrome.
Please
do
not
hesitate
to
ask
for
more
details.
Thanks
in

to
anyone
who
can

Addon
buttons
dissappear
after

I
downloaded
Firefox
today
and
I'm

Page
WE.
I
can
install
them
just
fine
and
their

will
show
up
in

However,
if
I
close
Firefox
and
open
it
again
the
buttons
will
be
gone
and
the
addons
will
only
work
in
websites
I
had

before

They
still
show

again
if
I
deactivate

activate

as

as
I

the

Mutta

Jos

sitten
aukaisee
toiseen

uuden,
ennen
kuin

jämähtää

Ainoastaan
päivittämällä
saa
sivuston
uudelleen
latautumaan,
mutta
tällöin
toisissa

olevat
sivut
jumiutuvat.
Youtube
tämän
takia

Välillä

ei
toimi
ollenkaan,
vaikkei

Sivusto
aukeaa
hyvin
ja
bufferoi

johon

pysäyttää

Kun

Eby
Flash
plugin
crashing
constantly
For
the
last
few
days
(I'm
not
exactly
sure
since
when)
Flash
Player
has
been
crashing
immediately
when
a
page
with
a
Flash
video
loads
up
and
reloading
the
page
does
not
fix
it.
I've
tried
visiting
the
same
pages
using
Microsoft
Edge
and
the
videos
seemed
to
play
fine,
so
I
assume
this
is
an
issue
with
Firefox.
I'm
on
a
Windows
10
64
bit
machine.
I've
updated
my
graphics
card
drivers,
updated
Flash
Player
and
disabled
a
video
download
app/extension
that
I
thought
could
possibly
be
causing
problems
but
none
of
these
steps
worked.
The
next
step
I'd
normally
take
is
to
disable
hardware
acceleration
in
the
Flash
Player
settings,
however
I
can't
access
them.
When
the
Flash
Player
crashes
it
comes
up
with
a
sad
face
graphic
and
asks
me
if
I'd
like
to
send
a
crash
report.
Right
clicking
does
not
bring
up
the
option
to
enter
the
Flash
Player
settings
menu.
I
don't
know
whether
this
problem
(being
unable
to
access
the
settings)
is
caused
by
Flash
or
Firefox.
For
now
I've
disabled
hardware
acceleration
in
Firefox.
Videos
now
play
but
when
I
scroll
down
a
page
I
get
a
lot
of
screen
tearing.
I've
not
had
enough
time
yet
to
see
if
this
has
caused
any
other
ill
effects.
I'm
guessing
that
I
shouldn't
need
to
disable
hardware
acceleration
if
the
browser
is
working
properly
(and
everything
else
is
up
to
date),
so
I
hope
that
this
issue
is
fixed
soon.

Before
continuing,
note
well:
LastPass
continues
to
work
properly
in,
e.g.:
Brave,
Chrome,
IE,
Opera,
etc.
The
problem
is
with
Firefox,
not
with
LastPass.
If
LastPass
works
properly
with
other
browsers
commonly
in
use,
and
fails
to
work
with

identifying
the
source
of
the
problem
is
obvious.
(hint:
It's
not
LastPass.)

successfully
using

(v

I
updated

to
work
properly,
so
I
attempted
to
revert
to
Firefox
v

LastPass's

The

is
with

view
and
listen
to
this
website
on
Microsoft
edge,
but
I
prefer
Firefox,
generally.
Is
there
a
fix
or
add
on
that
will
allow
the
audio?
When
I
open
a
PDF
file
online,
it's
very
slow
in
filling
the
page
when
scrolling
down;
and
slow
when
typing
in
email.
I
have
to
wait
for
it
to
catch
up.
Why?
When
I
scroll
down
from
page
to
page,
after
opening
a
PDF
file
online,
it
is
very
slow
in
filling
the
page
with
its
content.
I
have
to
wait
for
it
to
catch
up.
This
doesn't
happen
with
Edge
or
Chrome.
This
slowness
also
happens
when
typing
an
email.
I'm
a
fast
typer
and
I
can
tell
that
it
doesn't
keep
up
with
me
sometimes.
Any
suggestions?
Thanks...
Firefox
loads
C:\\documentsandsettings\\username\\localsettings\\temp
with
empty
files
and
it
clogs
the
system.
Tried
IE
and
it
does
not
do
that.
What
is
answer?
When
Firefox
runs
it
creates
a
series
of
empty
temp
files
in
C:\\documentsandsettings\\username\\localsettings\\temp.
These
files
become
so
numerous
that
they
clog
the
system.
I
tried
IE
and
other
software
and
they
do
not
cause
the
problem.
Only
Firefox
does
it.
If
it's
malware,
and
it
probably
is,
what
do
I
look
for?
AVG
and
Malwarebytes
full
scans
have
not
found
anything.
The
file
names
are
a
succession
of
hex
numbers
with
a
.tmp
extention;
such
as
4f23.tmp
4f24.tmp
4f25.tmp
etc.
If
I
don't
delete
these
files
after
every
firefox
session
they
will
accumulate
into
the
hundreds
of
thousands
of
empty
.tmp
files
slowing
the
system
to
a
halt.
This
only
came
about
very
recently.

used
to
work

fine
on

My
internet
keeps
switching
to
proxy.
Did
what
you
tole
others
to
do
and
it
would
not
allow
me
to
click
on
switch
to
no
proxy
I
have
problems
on
my
computer
with
the
internet
connection
always
switching
out
of
automatic
to
proxy
and
then
it
either
does
not
connect
or
takes
forever.
So
I
decided
to
use
Firefox
as
my
browser
as
I
read
that
I
can
control
it
and
with
IE
I
could
not.
I
read
on
the
help
menu
how
it
is
best
to
switch
to
no
proxy
in
the
advanced
section
but
that
box
in
Firefox
advanced
will
not
allow
me
to
do
that.
What
should
I
do
now?
It
takes
so
much
time
all
day
long
to
switch
it
out
of
proxy
on
my
computer.
Any
ideas?

Firefox
has
a
serious
problem
on
its
hands
Ever
since
it
upgraded
to
V54
Firefox
has
developed
a
cascade
of
problems
one
right
after
the
other.
In
one
day
the
following
occurred.
1.
Bookmarks
could
not
be
imported
from
HTML
file
2.
Firefox
won't
boot
up
or
if
it
does
it
gets
stuck
and
often
never
finishes
loading.
3.
web
pages
load
much
slower
than
normal.
4.
Online
games
won't
play
well
5.
Lag
time
develops
when
typing
and
switching
web
pages
6.
web
pages
don't
load
well
(jerky)
7.
Operations
on
web
pages
very
slow
to
function
or
sometimes
don't.
8.
YouTube
buffers
a
lot
9.
In
general
it
feels
like
you
are
on
a
1meg
internet
line
with
insufficient
ram.
My
serious
suggestion
is
to
roll
back
all
the
upgrades
to
say
V51
or
52
to
where
it
was
stable
and
pull
all
the
other
upgrades
off
line
until
you
can
properly
sort
out
the
problems.
Failure
to
do
so
will
mean
people
will
move
to
another
browser.
Nobody
is
going
to
put
up
with
this
sort
of
poor
performance
for
long.
I
don't
even
like
to
click
the
icon
for
fear
it
either
won't
load
or
will
take
forever
to
load.
FF
used
to
perform
flawlessly.
Now
its
a
joke.
Can
you
say
hello
Opera.
I
don't
have
time
to
waste
on
a
broken
browser.

searching

installing

running
a

checker
and
nothing
works.
They
used
to
play
until
the
most
recent
update.
I
will
not
refresh
Firefox
since
I
have
years
worth
of
bookmarks
in
many
different
categories
and
I
use
many
of
them
for
my
business.

Why
is
firefox
using
commas
for
decimal
points,
despite
my
system
settings?
For
some
unknown
reason,
my
Firefox
v55
is
using
commas
for
decimal
points
is
spite
of
Ubuntu
16.04's
setting
of
Australian
English.
Prior
to
this
version,
it
was
using
the
correct
character.
I
checked
about:config
and
changed
'general.useragent.locale'
to
'en-AU'
instead
of
'en-ZA'
(Why
it
was
set
to
that,
I
don't
know.).
Other
than
that,
I
can't
find
a

that
would
fix
it.

an
extension
to
get
them
in
Firefox.
I
found
one
(FXChrome),
but
it
won't
let
me
keep
my
current
theme.
I'm
just
wondering
if
any
of
you
have
an
idea
as
to
how
I
can
do
this?
Thanks!
My
firefox
is
crashing
within
about
5-10
seconds
(sometimes
instantly)
of
loading
a
page
with
a
youtube
video.
did
not
happen
before.
I
recently
upgraded
from
my
old
processor
to
a
threadripper
1920x
and
so
had
to
reinstall
windows
(
and
thus
firefox).
Prior
to
this
(aug
14-15),
firefox
worked
fine.
However
now
any
time
i
try
and
watch
a
youtube
video
it
crashes
firefox
with
no
crash
report
or
anything.
Yet,
on
52.0.2
it
plays
youtube
videos
perfectly
fine.
I'm
sure
this
is
significant,
but
I
have
no
idea
what
has
changed
in
the
meantime.
all
my
graphics
drivers,
flash,
windows
updates,
and
antivirus
are
up
to
date
with
the
exceptions
needed
for
firefox
in
the
antivirus.
I've
tried
safe
mode
with
no
addons
and
i've
tried
reinstalling
several
times.
it
always
crashes
the
youtube
video.
I'm
kind
of
at
a
loss
here
because
i
really
like
firefox
but
if
i
dont
get
this
fixed
i'll
have
to
switch
to
another
browser.
EDIT
1:
also,
forcing
youtube
to
use
flash
seemed
to
help
for
a
bit,
but
that
didnt
let
me
view
youtube
in
the
highest
quality
anymore.
for
example,
a
video
i
could
watch
in
1080
i
could
only
watch
in
720p
on
forced
flash.
this
is
particularly
bad
for
me
since
i
watch
a
lot
of
4k
content.

EDIT
2:
These
are
all
the
reports
I
have.
It
has
crashed
probably
30-40
times,
but
it
just
crashes
to
desktop
without
making
a
report
attempt
or
log
as
far
as
I
can
tell.

Hi

I'm

Solution?
I've
just
bought
a

my

Everything
works
fine

for

When

the

the

the

are
tiny.
I
can

of

Miksi
'Lähetä
linkki
sähköpostilla'
ei
suostu
toimimaan
Microsoft
Outlook
2016
-sovelluksella?
Esimiehelläni
on
ollut
tapana
lähettää
julkisen
hankinnan
linkkejä
tarjouslaskijalleen.
Aiemmin
hän
on
onnistunut
siinä
vallan
mainiosti
painamalla
'Lähet
linkki
sähköpostilla'
-nappia
Firefoxissa.
Nyt,
kun
vaihtoi
tietokonetta,
eivät
nämä
asetukset
selkeästi
ole
täysin
oikein.
Nappi
lisättiin,
mutta
sille
oli
määritetty
Asetuksista
väärä
oletusohjelma.
Vaihdoin
Oletusohjelmaksi
'mailto'
-linkeille
'Käytä
sovellusta
Microsoft
Outlook'.
Tämän
jälkeen
tuon
napin
painaminen
aiheuttaa
sen,
että
Windows
käynnistää
kaksi
Outlookia,
toisen,
joka
on
Windowsissa
itsessään
oletussähköpostina,
sekä
erikseen
tuon
Microsot
Outlook
2016
-ohjelman.
Näistä
vain
Windowsin
oma
versio
ymmärtää,
että
tämä
linkki
halutaan
lähettää.
Valitettavasti
esimieheni
ei
halua
käyttää
tätä
sähköpostiohjelmaa,
vaan
Microsoft
Outlook
2016
-ohjelmistoaan,
josta
hän
hoitaa
kaiken
muunkin
sähköpostin.
Microsoft
Outlook
2016
-ohjemisto
antaa
napin
painamisen
jälkeen
virhesanoman
'Sivulle
siirtyminen
peruutettiin.
Voit
yrittää
seuraavaa:
Kirjoita
osoite
uudelleen.'
Itse
saan
siis
sen
käsityksen,
että
Outlook
yrittää
avata
kyseisen
linkin
jollakin
tavalla
itse
sähköpostiohjelmassa.

How
do

doing

How
do
I
stop
it
doing
so?
When
firefox
says:
a

your
browser
what
do
you
want
to
do?
>wait
>stop
it,
does
it
let
the
page
continue
by
default?
I
created
a
javascript
script
that
generates
the
mandlebrot
set
using
P5.JS
.
It's
worked
fine
for
smaller
versions,
but
now
I
want
to
try
creating
a
large
version
to
save
as
my
desktop

however
Firefox
keeps
telling
me:
'a
web

slowing
down
your
browser
what
do
you
want
to
do?'
then
giving
me
the
choice
between
'wait'
and
'stop
it'.
If
I
click
wait,
it
will
shortly
ask
me
again.
This
is
annoying
for
two
reasons:
I
don't
know
if
the
script
will
continue
if
I
don't
click
wait,
and
I
want
to
just
leave
my
computer
for
a
few
hours
while
it
works
stuff
out,
which
I
can't
do
if
I
constantly
have
to
click
wait
and
I
don't
need
telling
the
browser
is
being
slowed
down,
I
know
that
will
happen
as
a
result
of
my
script.
Is
there
anything
I
can
do
to
get
rid
of
this
message
for
my
specific
page?
Will

to

How
is
the
situation
now,
concerning
the
end
of
support
for
Vista-users
?
On
it's
site,
Firefox
announces:
'Important
-
Firefox
is
ending
support
for
Windows
XP
and
Windows
Vista',
stating
that
security
updates
will
continue
untill
September
2017.
And
then:
'In
mid-2017,
a
final
support
end
date
will
be
announced'
[...]
Also,
on
the
same
page
it
is
announced
that
by
March
XP
and
Vista
users
'will
automatically
be
updated
to
the
Extended
Support
Release
[hyperlinked]
version
of
Firefox.'
Sounds
good:
users
should
-
according
to
this
-
still
continue
enjoying
some
form
of
support.
However,
when
following
the
hyperlink,
one
is
informed
that
this
only
is
valid
for
GROUP
-
users
!
What
about
that?
Not
ALL
users
?
So
the
quoted
text
is
incorrect
?!?
Any
information
on
that
?
Maybe
the
forum
is
not
the
right
place
to
answer
my
question,
but
since
Firefox
itself
seems
to
stay
mum...

question
was

in

and
eventually
marked
as
'Solved'
by
the

(but
not
for
me)
,
I
followed
all
the
advise
in
that
thread
to
no
avail
,
Please
see
below
.
Sometimes
as
much
as
3
-4
times
with
in
a
12
hour
period
'FF'
will
'UPDATE'
from
ver.
54.0.1
(which
is
stable)
to
Ver.
55.0.2
(which
has
bug's)
,
the
auto-update
has
been
turned
OFF
but
'FF'
does
it
anyway.
Not
only
does
it
do
an
unwanted
update,
but
when
it
does
it
'Re-arranges'
and
removes
(some
of
)
the
folders
in
my
bookmarks
tool
bar.
My
current
routine
is
:
When
starting
up
'FF'
first
time
of
a
morning
I
check
the
version
and
check
to
see
that
the
bookmark's
are
in
their
proper
order,
if
they
are
everything
is
fine
(for
maybe
an
hour)
,
at
some
point
the
screen
will
blink
and
I
will
now
be
on
Ver.
55.0.2
and
the
bookmarks
tool
bar
will
be
all
screwed
up
again
(
and
bookmarks
will
be
slow
to
respond
as
well
as
slow
to
put
the
options
on
screen)
.
I
then
have
to
close
the
browser,
reload
ver.
54,
and
then
restore
the
bookmark's
from
an
earlier
version
and
wait
for
the
next
screw
up
and
start
the
process
all
over
again.
The
OS
here
is

.
I
have
tried
everything
suggested
in
the

(I
am

thought's

The

message
reads
'Server
Failed:

I
have
received
this
message
over
a
week
every
time
I
try
to
login
with
Firefox.
I
can
login
in
with
other
browsers,
I
just
prefer
not
to.
I
have
two
computers
synced.
How
does
Firefox
know
which
one
is
the
master
device?
I
updated
Firefox
to
version
55.0.2
yesterday.
After
restarting
I
lost
all
the
data
in
the
browser
bookmarks,
the
session
and
also
it
logged
me
out
of
the
sync.
After
logging
in
it
started
syncing
but
it
didn't
sync
the
bookmarks.
I
decided
to
restore
the
system,
but
after
doing
so
although
the
session
was
back
all
the
other
data
was
not
there.
I
synced
again
and
bookmarks
didn't
sync.
Finally
after
logging
out
and
in
again
I
managed
to
get
the
bookmarks
back.
However
I
noticed
that
it
was
a
problem
with
a
plugin
which
caused
this.
It
was
the
theme
that
was
not
compatible
with
the
new
version
of
Firefox.
So
now
I
have
the
old
theme
on
my
laptop,
and
different
one
on
my
desktop.
Both
computers
are
synced
but
the
theme
is
different
on
my
desktop.
My
question
is:
How
does
Firefox
know
which
device
is
the
master
device?
If
i
remove
a
plugin
let's
say
FlashBlock
on
one
machine,
it
gets
removed
on
the
other
machine.
What
if
i
lost
all
my
data
from
the
browser
and
it
started
syncing
and
removing
all
the
plugins
and
bookmarks
thinking
that
i
just
want
to
remove
everything,
and
then
the
other
computer
lost
it
too.
Is
it
possible?
I
am
trying
to
connect

website,

problemas
com
seleção
em
combos
Bom
dia.
Estou
com
um
problema
na
versão
55.0.2
do
Firefox,
mas
não
em
todos
os
computadores.
Tenho
uma
aplicação
onde
tenho
telas
com
combos.
Ao
tentar
selecionar
uma
opção
da
combo,
a
seleção
fica
pulando
entre
as
opções
sem
que
eu
consiga
selecionar.
Ao
tirar
o
mouse
da
combo
e
posicionar
novamente
consigo
operar
a
combo
normalmente.
Se
eu
fechar
a
tela
e
abrir
novamente
o
problema
volta
a
ocorrer.
Estranho
que
isso
está
ocorrendo
apenas
em
alguns
computadores.
Já
testei
a
mesma
tela
em
outros
navegadores
e
o
problema
não
ocorre.
Também
instalei
uma
versão
mais
antiga
do
Firefox
(40.0)
e
o
problema
não
aparece.
Já
tentei
desabilitar
a
aceleração
de
hardware
pois
no
passado
já
tive
problemas
de
lentidão
com
esse
recurso,
porém
sem
sucesso.
Alguém
também
está
passando
por
este
problema?
How
do
I
delete
logins
and
passwords
on
Mac
in
FF
v55
For
example
when
I
login
to
YouTube
or
eBay,
my
Username
is
pre-filled
in
and
next
click
fills
in
the
password.
Since
passwords
change
from
time
to
time
they
are
not
correct
so
I
want
to
delete
them.
Is
this
a
Keychain
thing?
I
need
to
log
out
of
one
sync
account
and
log
into
another.
I
am
trying
to
log
out
of
my
current
sync
account
and
log
into
another.
This
must
include
all
bookmarks,
as
I
do
not
want
to
merge
the
two
accounts.
The
other
account
has
vital
resources
and
bookmarks.
The
two
must
be
kept
separate.
Cannot
understand
why
this
is
such
a
chore.
It
should
be
a
simple
matter
surely
-
log
out
of
one
account,
log
into
another.

but
am
very
frustrated)

My
Bookmarks
keep
changing
and
I
have
re-download
them
from
a
saved
file.
Why?
As
long
as
I
am
on
one
computer
the
bookmarks
are
fine.
As
soon
as
I
open
the
browser
on
another
computer
the
bookmarks
all
change
and
not
to
the
ones
that
I
last
had.
I
have
to

from

I
have.
Then
if

change
again.

do
I
fix
this?
I
only
want
one
set
of

what
is
the
difference
in
x64
and
x86?
I
updated
to
55.02
and
it
installed
a
second
firefox
instead
of
updating
the
old.
I
had
one
that
said
x64
and
one
that
said
x86.
I
assumed
that
x86
was
the
new
install
since
my
computer
is
64bit
and
unistalled
the
one
that
said
x86
because
the
program
files
were
labeled
the
same.
However
it
was
not
the
new
install
but
the
one
that
had
been
updated.
Now
it
is
really
slow.
how
do
I
get
back
to
the
old
one?
Is
there
a
setting
to
allow
more
response
time
for
location
request?
Hello
All,
I
know
how
to
turn
off
all
location
requests
-
that
is
not
what
my
problem
is.
When
I
visit
a
website
that
wants
permission
to
access
my
location,
the
pop-up
to
'block'
or
'allow'
very
rarely
stays
open
long
enough
for
me
to
click
my
choice!
So
I
would
like
to
know
if
anyone
knows
a
way
to
make
the
pop-up
slow
down,
or
stay
open
UNTIL
I
click
a
choice.
TIA!

No

Slow
TLS
handshake
Hello,
In
the
past
few
weeks
Firefox
has
started
experiencing
painfully
slow
TLS
handshakes
to
websites,
upwards
of
30
seconds.
There
doesn't
seem
to
be
any
pattern
to
it,
it
could
be
websites
I've
never
visited
before,
maybe
once
a
while
back,
or
3
minutes
ago.
It's
also
intermittent,
it
might
work
fine
for
2
hours,
maybe
even
a
whole
day,
then
suddenly
it
does
it
with
what
feels
like
every
website
and
content
linked
to
that
site
from
other
sites.
I've
tried
disabling
all
addons,
with
no
success.
When
it
does
happen
I've
tried
accessing
the
website
with
another
browser,
which
handles
it
just
fine,
so
it
doesn't
appear
to
be
the
websites.
Anyone
know
what
could
cause
this
and
possibly
fix
it?
Thank
you
in
advance.
Firefox
54.01
and
55.02
are
opening
email
links
as
blank
pages..what
can
I
do
to
rectify
this?
On
version
54.01
and
now
after
an
update
to
version
55.02,
I'm
trying
to
open
email
links
and
each
time
I
click
on
a
link,
Firefox
opens
a
new
tab,
but
it's
just
a
blank
page..
I
noticed
a
couple
of
weeks
ago,
that
this
problem
was
happening,
but
I
don't
think
anything
has
changed
on
my
system..
Is
there
a
setting
I
can
alter?

So
to
compare,
I
tried

that
the

In
Chrome,
the

does
work
but
stutters,
probably
because
Chrome
imposes
an
animated
chat-sidebar
which
is
too
much
for
the
32-bits
to
handle.
So
basically
I
now
cannot
watch
many
of

This
confounds
me.

found

the
latter
test-site

for
me.</b>
I
think
I'll
try
RESETing
firefox
now,
and
see
what
happens,
Does
that
make
sense?
Or
anything
else?
Thanks.
<b>Update:</b>
I
reset/refreshed
firefox,

still
remain
with
the
problem.
Upon
research,
I
came
across

someone

Is
it
just
me
or
are
others
having
problems
with
firefox
locking
up
when
it
starts
to
my
homepage?
When
I
click
on
the
firefox
icon
on
my
desktop,
it
loads
my
homepage..or
at
least
tries
to.
It
goes
non
responsive
for
around
45
seconds
before
it
loads
the
page.
All
other
pages
load
fine
after
this.
If
I
click
a
link
that
starts
firefox,
the
same
thing
happens.
Just
been
since
the
last
update.
I've
checked
with
friends
and
they're
all
having
the
same
problem.
What's
up
with
this?
Selenium
IDE
no
longer
works
and
cannot
be
installed
with
any
version
of
FF.
How
do
I
fix
that?
I
had
version
45
ESR
installed.
I
had
the
Selenium
IDE
plugin
installed
and
it
worked.
I
was
experimenting
with
other
FF
versions
(55,
54)
to
see
if
they
work
with
the
Selenium
IDE.
I
installed
the
ESR
version
55
and
it
worked.
I
installed
ESR
version
54,
it
worked.
Everything
seemed
to
work.
Then
I
uninstalled
the
Selenium
IDE.
I
have
gone
back
to
version
45
and
it
says
that,
'the
Selenium
IDE
is
incompatible
with
this
version
of
FF'.
Selenium
IDE
is
the
only
reason
I
have
FF.
How
do
I
fix
this?
By
the
way,
whoever
thought
that
this
was
a
good
idea
is
gravely
mistaken.
It
works
with
version
1,
version
2,
version
3,
version
n
-
uninstall
the
plugin
and
even
if
I
go
back
to
version
1
I
cannot
install
it?

not
an

to

have

for

experiencing
some

problems
(hangs

and
FF
creating
two

of

(as
seen
in

I
checked
to
see
if
there
was
another

which
I
could
migrate
and
noticed
there
is
a
Firefox

Is
that

I
have

set
up
and
I've
confirmed
it
is
syncing
properly.
I
have
a
bookmark
on
the
bookmarks
toolbar
that
I
have
been
using
since
I
first
set
up
the

account
to
let
me
see

from
my

However,
as

this
bookmark
no

works
and
I
can't
seem
to
find
what
has
replaced
it.
The

is
about:sync-tabs
and
before
Firefox

it
showed
the
list
of

and
the

underneath
each

name.
Now
it
just
says

Firefox
on

I
want
to
uninstall

64-bit
and
install
FF
32-bit
(because
I
want

like
ADBlocker
Plus,
and
they
won't

-
or
worse
install
but
not
show

-
in

64-bit).
1)
I
go
to
https://www.mozilla.org,
which
becomes
https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/
.
I
click
'Firefox'
and
I
am
at
https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/new/
.
2)
I
click
'Firefox
for
Other
Platforms
and
Languages'
and
I
get
a
dialog
where
I
click
'Windows
32-bit'.
I
get
'Firefox
Installer.exe'.
3)
I
close
and
uninstall
FF
64-bit
from
Control
Panel.
4)
I
run
that
exe
and
after
the
install
process
I
do
have
FF
again,
but
it's
still
the
64-bit
version.
It
has
even
remembered
my
session
and
bookmarks
and
I
am
even
still
logged
in
to
sites
I
was
logged
in
to
before
uninstalling
(those
for
which
I
had
asked
to
be
kept
logged
in
of
course).
I
tried
that
same
process
many
times,
by
downloading
FF
with
FF
itself
and
with
other
browsers.
I
have
even
unistalled
a
'Mozilla
Maintenance
Service'
I
found
installed
in
Control
Panel,
in
case
it
was
it
that
was
forcing
the
wrong
version
to
be
installed,
but
no.
I
also
tried
to
click
'Available
languages'
in
the
dialog
at
point
2,
clicked
on
'Download'
at
row
'English
(British)'
and
column
'Windows'
(NOT
the
'Windows
64-bit'
at
its
right),
that
gave
me
'Firefox
Setup
55.0.2.exe',
but
this
installer
too
produces
the
same
result
(I
end
up
with
the
64-bit
version
again).
No
error
messages
ever
appear
at
any
point.
I
simply
can't
seem
to
be

Lost

I
open

When
I
click

nothing

working
a
couple
of
months
ago.
Wanted
to
make
some

the

And
could
not

I
have

one
of
the
Firefox
ext.
...Theme
Font

keep
disappearing
so
I
kept
on

then
disappearing
again
&
again.
Then
tried
an
older
version
of
TFSC
worked
for
a
day
or
two
then
that
also
disappeared
.
NOTE:
by
disappearing
I
mean
their
was
no
way
of
accessing
the

and
all
the

were
out
of

.
but
was
still
listed
in
the

page
as
enabled.
And
still
in
my

So
I
just
got
feed
up
and
disabled
and
uninstalled
the
ext.(apparently
other
users
were
having
same
issues
as
of
late).
With
all
this
installing/uninstalling
of
this
ext.
Did
it
take
or
corrupt
this

tab
with
it.
I
cant
find
it
any
where.

gpu
overheats
resulting
in
BSOD
when
using
livefeed
webcams
Shortly
after
the
last
FF
upgrade,
(55.0.2),
I
started
getting
a
BSOD
when
using
webcam.
The
screen
just
went
black
after
a
few
minutes
and
displayed
no
error
messages.
My
research
took
me
to
open
hardware
monitor
which
i
downloaded.
Everything
worked
just
fine
until
I
activated
a
webcam
(either
outgoing
or
incoming).
That's
when
I
could
see
the
GPU
temperature
steadily
climb
until
somewhere
around
220
degreesF
and
suddenly
there
was
the
BSOD.
If
I
stopped
the
webcam
before
I
reached
that
temperatutre
level,
I
could
the
temperature
get
lower.
Using
all
the
same
stuff,
I
never
had
a
problem
until
around
the
time
of
the
last
update.
I
cleaned
up
around
the
fans
but
they
really
were
not
that
dusty.
I
was
thinking
about
replacing
the
graphics
card,
but
first
tried
running
on
Microsoft
Edge.
Absolutely
no
problems.
Temperatures
remained
low,
fan
speed
stayed
low
(fan
got
up
to
100%
as
it
heated
up
when
using
FF).
and
could
use
he
webcams
for
an
hour
with
no
BSOD,
minimal
rise
in
GPU
and
minimal
fan
speed.
Granted,
my
computer
technical
knowledge
is
limited,
but
I
can
interpret
the
obvious
conclusion
that
my
computer
is
not
at
fault
since
GPU
overheating
and
the
resulting
BSOD
only
happens
when
using
webcams
with
FF
and
everything
works
perfectly
when
using
MS
EDGE.
I
have
no
problem
playing
videos,
just
with
livestreaming
webcams.
Any
enlightened
comments
or
suggestions
would
be
appreciated.

Hide
navbar
in
fullscreen
mode
Hi,
I
wonder
if
it
is
possible
to
hide
the
navigation
bar
in
fullscreen
mode.
Currently,
I
have
all
toolbars
hidden
by
default
and
only
display
the
tabbar
(to
the
left
via
test
pilot)
and
the
navbar
(ontop
with
some
extensions
to
the
right
of
it).
When
I
click
F11
to
go
into
full
screen
mode,
I
would
expect
all
bars
to
be
hidden
and
then
content
to
be
displayed
on
the
entire
screen,
however,
only
the
tab
bar
is
hidden
for
me
when
I
press
F11.
Is
there
a
way
to
achieve
this?
I
am
on
Firefox
55.0.2
on
Linux,
and
none
of
the
extensions
I
have
seen
are
compatible
with
this
browser,
or
support
hiding
the
navbar
only
in
fullscreen
mode.
Where
is
the
secondary
email
option
mentioned
in
the
article
'Change
primary
email
address
on
Firefox
Accounts'?
The
linked
article
(https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/change-primary-email-address-firefox-accounts)
says
you
can
set
up
a
secondary
email
for
your
Sync
account
in
your
account
settings
page,
and
after
that
you
can
change
the
primary
email
account
if
you
wish,
but
I
do
not
find
the
option.
The
only
options
that
are
appearing
in
my
account
settings
page
are:
account
picture,
display
name,
devices
&
apps,
password
and
delete
account
(I
attach
an
screen-shot).
I'm
running
Firefox
55.0.2
on
Ubuntu
14.04LTS
(64
bits).
Thanks
in
advance
for
your
help.
PS:
I
had
to
edit
this
question
because
it
seems
the

did
not

in

I
uploaded

Sites
I

Many
sites
I
frequently

now
being

How
can
I
troubleshoot
add-on
validation
failure.
My
extension
doesn't
load
into
Firefox
(local
installation,
not
downloaded
from
the
store),
I
get
an
error
message
stating
'Extension
could
not
be
verified
for
use
in
Firefox
and
has
been
disabled'.
Unfortunately
I
can't
find
any
details
as
to
why
the
validation
fails
which
prevents
me
from
understanding
the
reason
and
fix
it.
I
tried
starting
from
the
command
line
with
-attach-console
parameter
but
I
only
get
a
warning
that
doesn't
bring
more
information.
It
looks
like
I
could
set
some
environment
variable
to
raise
the
logging
level
but
as
I
don't
have
any
clue
about
the
module
name
to
use
I
can't
get
debug
infos.
Any
idea
on
how
to
troubleshoot
this
kind
of
issue
is
welcome.

There

be

every

How

it
and

NOT

that

I
recently

FireFox.
However,
the
link
takes
me
to
a
page
that
says
'you
have
to
update
your
firefox
to
take
survey.'
I
do
not
want
to
update
my
firefox.
The
'newest'
'Best!'
version
sucks.
I
have
determined
that
I
will
no
longer
update
my
firefox.
you
guys
dropped
the
ball
and
now
I
have
to
use
some
outdated
version
because
the
new
one
has
been
deemed
unusable
by
me.
So
here
is
my
rating.
ZERO!
Should
you,
in
your
infinite
wisdom,
conclude
that
my
outdated
version
can
no
longer
be
used,
I
will
of
course
gladly
stop
using
firefox.
There
are
plenty
of
other
browsers
out
there.
Way
to
go

Please
pass
these
comments
on
to
the
proper
people
who
asked
for
a
survey
in
the
first
place.
Thank
you.

Freshly

often
Hi,
so
I
thought
I
should
try
and
install
FireFox.
But
I
noticed
that
it's
super
slow
although
I
just
installed
it.
All
Add-Ons
I'm
using
are
PrivacyBadger,
EnhandedYouTube
and
AdBlock.
Disabling
any
did
not
fix
my
issue.
I
often
encounter
super
long
loading
times
or
FF
freezes
for
a
couple
of
seconds.
RAM
and
CPU
usage
are
ok,
200mb
RAM
and
+-5%
CPU.
Doesn't
matter
if
a
game
is
running
or
not,
it's
always
the
same
with
the
'lags'
and
long
loading
times.
In
between
it's
super
fast
for
a
brief
moment
but
then
it's
slow
again.
Since
I'm
no
expert
I
have
no
real
idea
what
could
cause
the
issue,
so
if
you
need
any
more
info
just
ask
and
I
try
to
provide
it.
Oh
and
I
forgot
to
add:
whenever
I
open
a
YT
Video
and
change
tab,
it
plays
not
even
1
second
and
then
automatically
pauses.
Can't
select
partial
URL
in
the
address
bar?
So,
I
was
attempting
to
share
a
YouTube
video
with
a
friend
while
I
was
in
a
playlist.
When
you're
in
a
playlist,
the
link
has
an
unearthly
amount
of
coding
attached,
which
I
always
remove.
However,
I
tried
copying
the
partial
URL,
up
to
the
playlist
information,
it
refreshed
the
page.
I
tried
several
times
before
giving
up,
copying
the
whole
URL,
and
deleting
the
playlist
detail.
But
I
opened
a
new
tab,
clicked
the
address
bar
twice,
and
boom,
it
refreshed
the
page.
So,
for
some
reason,
when
I
double-click
on
the
address
bar,
it's
refreshing
the
page
instead
of
just
allowing
me
to
edit
the
link.
This
isn't
normally
going
to
be
a
hindrance,
but
I
select
partial
URLs
all
the
time,
so
I
would
like
to
know
how
to
fix
it.
Just
earlier
today,
I
removed
the
ALT
shortcuts,
as
they
were
messing
with
things
on
a
page
I
frequent.
Perhaps
this
caused
it?
Isn't
it
unethical
to
auto-update
when
user
has
checked
off
DON'T
UPDATE?
I
just
downloaded
47.0.1
and
checked
the
box
NOT
TO
UPDATE.
Five
minutes
later
a
Firefox
update
message
pops
up
reading:
'Restart
Firefox
to
update.'
In
the
box
below
is
a
sentence
saying
that
Mozilla
aims
to
keep
the
web
'ACCESSIBLE
TO
ALL.
Your
coding
has
shut
me
out,
unable
to
use
Firefox
with
my
system.
This
is
a
reoccurring
issue
facing
many
users.
Why
has
Mozilla
failed
to
change
the
coding
despite
all
the
complaints?
At
this
point
aren't
we
dealing
with
an
ethical
issue?

look

else
to

While
on

in
the

everything
slows
down
and
sometimes
locks
up.
While
in

it
sometimes
slows
down
but
not
as
often.
I
did
reset

a

back
and
lost
all
my

some
of
which
I
will
never
be
able

then
I
had
to

everything
I

How
can
the
lost

be
retrieved

how
can
I
get
the
speed
back
to
a
normal
operating

I
have
had

every

I
have
had

it

other

this

takes

'This

error
A
particular
page
is
giving
me
a
'this
page
isn't
redirecting
properly'
error.
Searching
the
forums
showed
another
person
having
this
problem
and
people
suggested
renaming
the
cookies
file
in
case
it
got
corrupted
and
doing
the
'Forget
about
this
site'
thing
in
my
history--I
tried
both
of
those
but
it
was
still
happening.
Then
I
reset
Firefox
and
it
stopped
happening
on
the
main
site,
but
now
it's
happening
on
a
subpage
of
the
site.
EDIT:
I
just
tried
it
in
Chrome
and
it's
not
working
there
either.
I
thought
it
was
a
Firefox
problem
because
when
it
was
happening
with
the
main
site
I
tried
it
in
Chrome
and
it
worked
there.
But
it
looks
like
having
it
with
the
subpage
is
a
problem
with
the
site,
not
Firefox.
I
guess
there
isn't
a
way
to
delete
this
question
now
that
I
know
it's
not
a
Firefox
problem.
I
guess
I
should've
checked
with
Chrome
before
I
posted,
but
I
didn't
think
to
since
when
it
was
happening
with
the
main
site
it
was
definitely
a
Firefox
problem.

Whenever
I
switch

I
am
constantly
getting
'Mozilla

Not
Responding'
in
a
blue
bar
at
the
top
of
the
browser
along
with
a
white
page
(where
previously
I'd
been
reading
a
website)
and
a
gear

in

in
the
middle.
I
sometimes
have
to
wait
up

5
minutes
for
the
browser
to
respond
again.
I
also
have
the
problem
that
Firefox
locks
up
if
I
open
the
Skype
app,
so
I
can
either
use
Skype
or
use
Firefox,
not
both
together.
After
resetting

exported
all
P/W
from
Google;
now,
each
time
I
open

all
P/W
have
disappears,
Why?
First,
I
used
Firefox
for
a
long
time
then,
on
a
friend
suggestion,
I
switch
to
Google,
didn't
like
it
so
I
came
back
with
Firefox.
That
's
when
i
realized
that
I
have
forgotten
my
Master
P/W,
followed
instruction
to
reset
the
Master
P/W.
Found
out
that
I
could
import
P/W
from
Google,
I
did
the
importation,
all
P/W
are
back.
Each
night,
I
close
Firefox
and
reopen
in
the
morning
and
when
I
do,
all
imported
P/W
have
disappears.
Firefox
remember
my
new
Master
P/W
but
the
P/W
themselves
are
all
gone.
Is
there
someone
who
has
had
the
same
problem?

any

there's
an
orange

right
above
the

that
says
'Verify

when
I
click
that
it

me

This

claims
that
my

when

nothing

Also,
I
have
an

The

was
installed
on

there
are
no

is
the
version
I
have
now.
It
used
to
open
with
thumbnails
of
the

No
more.
How
do
I
get
them
back?
Browser.storage.sync
with
private,
signed
extension
I've
attempted
to
use
browser.storage.sync
with
a
private,
Mozilla-signed
extension,
but
cannot
get
it
to
work.
Are
there
any
reasons
why
it
shouldn't?
To
be
specific,
I've
done
the
following
steps
*
Modified
https://github.com/mdn/webextensions-examples/tree/master/favourite-colour
to
use
browser.storage.sync
instead
of
browser.storage.local.

the

Why
sound
do
not
work
on
lightweight
Linux?
I
beg
you
to
enable
ALSA
by
default
and
maintain
it
working
for
the
sake
of
lightweight
community.
If
you
want
to
avoid
'multiple
audio
backends'
you
are
doing
it
wrong,
once
PulseAudio
depends
on
ALSA,
have
you
ever
tried
to
uninstall
libasound2?
The
application
may
be
easier
to
maintain,
but
the
system
pay
the
price,
if
you
want
to
drop
some
backend,
then
drop
PA
and
stick
with
ALSA,
once
every
system
that
have
PA
requires
ALSA.
Another
good
reason
is
not
to
lose
audience,
once
other
browsers
is
maintaining
ALSA
support,
the
problem
is
most
of
them
are
not
necessarily
lightweight.
And
there
is
a
plenty
of
lightweight
browsers
that
does
not
even
support
multimedia.
I
have
being
strong
on
my
choice
for
Firefox,
but
dropping
ALSA
support
is
forcing
me
to
look
for
alternatives,
please,
I
beg
you
to
reconsider
the
decision.

having
a
problem
with
a
web
site
Recently
I
have
been
having
a
lot
of
problems
with
a
web
site.
The
site
is
weatherunderground.com.
I
have
asked
for
help
with
that
web
site,
but
they
have
not
answered
any
of
my
questions
for
about
a
week
now,
so
I
thought
I
would
try
my
browser
for
help.
The
reason
I
ask
my
browser
(Firefox)
for
help
is
that
when
this
problem
appeared
with
this
web
site
another
issue
also
appeared
at
the
same
time.
That
issue
is,
it
now
takes
a
lot
longer
to
load
the
website
site
and
web
pages
within
that
site,
and
at
the
top
of
the
screen
I
see
a
drop
down
message
that
says
a
web
page
is
slowing
down
your
browser.
This
drop
down
message
never
used
to
appear
before.
When
I
click
on
'stop
it',
within
that
message,
to
see
what
that
will
do,
the
web
page
will
hang
up.
When
I
click
on
wait,
the
other
option,
the
page
will
progress
but
at
a
slow
pace,
as
it
does
all
the
time
now.
Any
reason
as
to
how
this
new
problem
with
a
web
site
I
use
all
the
time
(every
day)
is
now
appearing?
And,
more
importantly,
any
suggestions
as
to
how
and
remedy
the
problem?
Appreciate
any
help.
Thank
you.

Problem
with
Print
settings
with

Had
an
employee
having
a
problem
printing
in

of
an

Everytime
they
go
to
print
it
would
show
the
paper
size
as

and
then
print

never
showing

Hey
Guys.
We
want
to
deploy
our
Extension
to
a
whole
enterprise.
I've
viewed
the
distribution
page
but
I
wanted
to
see
if
there
is
a
better
solution
for
that:
In
chrome
you
can
deploy
a
key
containing
a
CRX
location
to
install.
Using
an
auto
update
file
you
can
install
the
whole
extension.
This
method
is
trusted
due
to
the
reason
that
the
person
that
is
able
to
deploy
it,
is
only
the
IT
administrator.
Is
there
any
way
similar
to
that
I
can
use?
If
not,
is
the
only
(simple)
way
is
by
dropping
the
.xpi
file
in
the
\\distribution\\Extension
location?
Do
I
still
need
to
enable
the
extension
?

What
is
the
status
of

WebIDE
in
Firefox?
With
the
change

for

OS,
I
was
wondering
what

future
is
of
the
WebIDE.
Google
is
blocked!!!
First...
Seriously???!!!
There
is
no
way
to
register
from

sign
in
page???!!!
What
a
goofy
process
just
to
register!!!
My
question
is:
Why
can't
I
get
to
Google
from
Firefox???!!!
Seems
like
Mozilla
is
pissed
at
Google
and
is
blocking
users
from
going
to
Google!!!
Don't
you
realize
this
will
cause
people
to
stop
using
Firefox???
There
needs
to
be
a
very
simple
work
around
for
users
for
YOUR
certificate
problem!!!
There
used
to
be
an
'I
understand
the
risks'
option.
Why
did
you
take
this
away???!!!
I
am
behind
a
corporate
firewall.
Trust
me
to
make
my
own
decisions!!!
how

deleated
hstory
back
Good
Afternoon:
I
was
on
pintrest
yesterday
and
the
day
before.
I
was
looking
at
pictures
of
furniture.
I
went
to
watch
tv
and
when
I
came
back
to
look
at
my
history
I
remembered
I
cleared
it.
It
says
on
my
computer
that
once
you
clear
history
this
action
cannot
be
undone.
IS
there
any
possible
trick
i
can
use
to
get
back
deleated
history?
Thanks

Just
linked
bookmarks
on
multiple
devices
and
sync
keeps
deleting
my
bookmarks?
In
early
August
I
finally
(after
a
million
years)
sunk
the
bookmarks
between
my
home
computer
and
my
laptop.
I
thought
I
selected
'merge'
bookmarks.
And
after
I
did
the
1st
sync
all
seemed
well
I
had
over
900
matching
bookmarks
on
my
home
computer.
But
then
a
couple
days
later
I
only
have
40
bookmarks
on
my
laptop.
I
keep
restoring
the
919
from

but
what
did
I
do
wrong
when
linking
the
computers.
And
what
do
I
need
to
do
to
stop
this
weird
deleting
of
all
my
bookmarks?
Thank
you!

Goodbye;
I've
gone
to
Chrome.
I
don't
know
why,
but
all
your
'developers'
have
tinkered
my
Firefox
right
out
of
existence.
It
used
to
be
good;
now
I'm
encountering
all
kinds
of
problems.
The
home
page
I've
used
for
/years/
is
listed
as
'not
secure.'
More
recently,
I
had
issues
with
posting
on
Facebook
and
Messenger.
Goodbye;
I've
gone
to
Chrome.
I
do
not
need
an
answer;
I
am
removing
Firefox
from
my
three
computers.
How
do
I
delete
single
form
data
entries
on
all
synced
devices?
Lets
say
I
have
an
old
email
address
my-old@email.tld
which
was
synced
as
value
for
email
fields.
Currently
I
delete
this
email
address
each
time
I
see
it
again
after
syncing
a
new
Firefox
profile.
Is
there
any
way
that
I
can
delete
the
address
from
the
forms
database
and
that
this
change
gets
synced?
What
could
cause
Firefox
to
stop

10
sec's

Firefox
hesitates

Crash
and
no
restore
option
So
had
an
unusual
situation.
Mozilla
crashed,
as
in,
it
shut
itself
down
with
some
kind
of
error
(did
not
catch
which)
When
I
started
up,
no
restore
option.
Okay.
Went
to
history,
restore
session
greyed
out,
uh
oh.....
So
I
did
some
googling
before
shutting
down,
and
I
backed
up
everything
in
the
session-store-backups
folder.
Turns
out
this
somehow
was
not
enough.
I
shut
down,
and
once
up
I
later
found
this
site
(would
have
maybe
been
more
helpful
BEFORE
shutting
down):
https://www.jeffersonscher.com/res/scrounger.html
This
is
very
handy,
I
tried
every
file
in
there,
and
no-go,
even
the
bak
file.
So
for
some
reason,
it
gives
me
a
session
from
eons
ago,
and
not
the
most
recent
one
when
it
crashed.
This
might
be
because
I
normally
end
sessions
with
tabs
still
open
by
closing
with
it
down
with
task-manager,
and
maybe
the
last
time
I
did
not
do
this
was
eons
ago
(like
6
weeks?)
not
sure,
but
it
still
seems
like
it
there
should
have
been
one
recent
backup
somewhere.
I
mean
each
morning
I
get
the
session
restore
prompt,
and
voila
there
are
all
my
tabs,
so
not
sure
where
the
heck
that
file
went
to
when
FF
crashed
itself
this
time'???/?
Since
then
I
have
shut
down
3
times,
so
I
imagine
I
am
hooped
now?
TIA
for
any
help/insight
Why
does
55.0.2
(64bit)
try
to
access
Amazon
AWS
after
it
is
closed?
I
use
Zonealarm
with
Win
7,
so
I
know
when
a
program
is
trying
to
access
the
Internet.
Of
course,
I
need
to
give
Firefox
access
through
Zonealarm,
and
that
works
fine.
However,
since
updating
to
55.0.2,
Zonealarm
flashes
up
a
warning
that
Firefox
is
trying
to
access
a
certain
URL
after
Firefox
has
shut
down.
I
deny
this
attempt
to
access
the
Internet
after
Firefox
has
shut
down.
Researching
the
IP
addresses
that
Zonealarm
reports,
I
find
that
there
are
several
and
they
all
trace
back
to
Amazon
AWS.
The
Firefox
installation
file
was
downloaded
from
your
web
site.
I
have
done
an
antivirus
scan
and
a
Malwarebytes
scan,
and
both
turn
up
nothing.
What
is
going
on?
Is
this
some
kind
of
tracking
or
reporting
gimmick?
Firefox
crashes
this
is
the
file
created
but
FF
crashes
even
with
new
profile
or
different
PC
login.

Adobe
Flash
doesn't
work.
How
can
I
fix
this?
I
have
updated
Flash
repeatedly
and
it
still
doesn't
work.
at

cannot
read
comments
javascript://
error
Hi
all...
Several
days
ago
I
upgraded
flash
and
java
on
my
pc.
That
same
day
I
went
to
www.liveleak.com.
When
I
tried
to
read
the
comments
that
are
below
the
videos,
the
comments
bar
would
disappear,
and
where
the
comments
should
be
was
only
a
blank
expanse.
This
also
occurs
in
Firefox,
palemoon,
opera,
and
chromium
browsers!
When
I
hover
the
mouse
arrow
over
the
comment
bar
I
see
this
in
the
lower
left
corner,
javascript://
I
frankly
have
no
idea
as
I've
looked
all
over,
I
suspect
that
it
is
a
virus,
or
malware,
but
I
have
d/l
several
anti-malware
programs
with
limited
success.
Some
of
the
comments
on
different
videos
do
work,
where
as
before
they
all
worked!
I
d/l
java
today
and
reinstalled,
with
a
+/-
result....Any
suggestions
are
welcome!
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
attention.

How
do
you
make
sure
that
you
do
not
block
or
spoof
the
referrer
to
resolve
my
blocked
video??
In
reference
about
my
blocked
video,
I
received
the
message
that:
<<Hmm.
I
noticed
that
I
once
togled
a
pref
to
spoof
the
referrer
to
match
the
calling
URL
(network.http.referer.spoofSource).
Resetting
this
pref
makes
the
video
work.
So
make
sure
that
you
do
not
block
or
spoof
the
referrer.
If
I
disable
the
referrer
then
I
only
get
sound
and
the
video
has
a
display:none;
attribute
and
is
hidden
because
of
this.>>
How?????
Why
did
SpeedDail
and
HideNavigationBar
add-ons
stop
working?
Firefox
was
having
memory
issues
late
last
week
and
was
having
to
crash
2
or
3
or
4
times
a
day.
When
i
woke
up
Sunday
and
opened-up
Firefox,
i
discovered
that
Firefox
must
have
automatically
updated
or
something
because
all
my
settings
had
reverted
to
their
default
state.
But
not
just
default
settings:
default
settings
without
any
of
my
themes,
add-ons,
or
extensions--
when
i
hadn't
removed
them
or
turned
them
off.
Some
of
them
i
was
able
to
re-install,
like
my
preferred
theme,
but
2
of
my
favorite
and
much
needed
add-ons
-
Hide
Navigation
Bar,
and
Speed
Dial
-
i
was
not
able
to
re-install
because
the
Firefox
add-on
page
for
these
2
add-ons
informed
that
'This
add-on
is
not
compatible
with
your
version
of
Firefox'.
Yes,
I
even
went
into
Help
/
About
Firefox,
which
automatically
did
a
version
update,
and
even
that
did
not
allow
me
to
install
these
2
add-on.
The
developer
for
HNB
got
back
to
me
and
is,
i
believe,
working
on
it.
The
contact
info
for
the
developer
for
Speed
Dial
seems
to
be
invalid.
My
email
to
the
Speed
Dial
developer
was
returned.
I
need
these
2
add-ons
more
than
i
need
an
up-to-date
version
of
a
browser.
Where
do
i
go
to
install
the
version
of
Firefox
that
was
compatible
with
these
2
add-ons?

Stop
autoload
navbar
predicted
websites
While
typing
an
url
or
a
search
in
the
address
bar,
firefox
will
propose
some
predictions
from
my
history
or
bookmarks,
but
it
will
always
load
the
first
result
while
i'm
still
typing.
This
is
really
annoying
since
it
ends
up
by
unselecting
the
address
bar
and
i
end
up
on
a
website
that
i
didn't
want
to.
For
example,
if
I'm
typing
'php
some
function
information...'
at
the
moment
i
finished
typing
php
and
press
the
spacebar,
I
end
up
on
php.net
landing
page.
And
if
I
type
a
search
or
an
url
quickly
enough,
firefox
have
loaded
3
or
4
different
pages
before
I
stopped
typing.
Can
someone
please
tell
me
how
to
stop
the
auto
loading
and
just
keep
the
predictions
?
Thanks
a
lot,
and
a
good

Zoom

The

4

I
don't
know
if
it
has
been
in
other
versions
this
year,
but
it
has
happened
in
the
past
on
different
systems,
with
either
linux
or
windows(7
and
10)
and
different
owners.
Basically
there
is
an
update
and
then
zoom
don't
work
(which
is
very
strange
as
zoom
is
a
build-in
function
since
Firefox
version
3)
-
then
there
is
a
new
update
and
zoom
works
again
-
then
a
new
update
and
zoom
don't
work
again
-
and
it
continues.
I
think
you
need
to
look
at
what
is
happening
and
why
this
happens
-
and
then
issue
an
update.
Kinda
stupid
that
build-in
function
gets
disabled
every
second
update.
I
know
I
can
install
an
addon
which
gives
me
the
feature,
but
then
I
could
continue
doing
that
everytime
'someone'
'forgets'
a
function
in
the
newest
update
-
better
get
it
sorted
out
now.
In
the
meantime
I
use
Zoom
page
WE(but
its
clutter,
I
could
live
without).
A
page
in
the
support
section
on
how
to
disable/enable
build-in
functions
through
about:config
would
be
nice.
And
to
keep
it
updated
if
major
changes
are
made.
You
have
some
very
old
guides
still
there,
going
back
to
firefox
3,
they
do
not
apply
to
firefox
55.
Hope
this
will
be
fixed
soon.

How
do
I
get
Firefox
to
display
correct
fonts
on
a
custom
home
page
located
on
my
computer
hard
drive?
I
am
using
Firefox
version
54.0.1,
32-bit
browser
on
both
operating
systems
of
a
dual
boot
system
running
Windows
10
Pro,
64-bit
and
Windows
7
Ultimate,
64-bit
operating
systems.
I
am
also
using
a
custom
Home
Page
that
I
created
and
have
stored
in
a
HomePage
directory
in
the
root
directory
on
my
primary
hard
drive.
On
that
home
page
is
a
list
of
frequently
accessed
links,
with
the
font
of
each
link
reflecting
the
font
used
by
the
linked
site.
For
example,
CVS
Pharmacy's
link
is
displayed
in
the
fonts
that
CVS
uses:
Arial
Black
14-pt.
for
the
'CVS',
and
Arial
12-pt.
for
the
word
'Pharmacy'.
That
brings
us
to
the
problem
I
am
having
with
Firefox,
a
problem
that
only
showed
up
in
the
last
two
or
three
versions
of
Firefox
long
after
I
installed
Windows
10;
so
the
operating
system
is
not
the
issue.
The
problem
is
with
the
correct
display
of
a
font
that
I
use
on
the
custom
Home
Page,
which
is
Arial
Black.
To
get
some
semblance
of
the
correct
fonts,
I
substituted
bolded
Arial
14-pt.
font
for
the
Arial
Black
14-pt.
font.
When
I
use
the
Arial
Black
font,
Firefox
displays
Times
New
Roman
instead
of
Arial
Black.
That
in
itself
is
odd
to
me,
since
Arial
is
a
sans
serif
font,
and
Times
New
Roman
is
a
serif
font.
Shouldn't
Firefox
at
least
display
a
sans
serif
font
as
a
substitute
for
the
sans
serif
font
called
for
in
the
Home
Page's
HTML
code?
Theoretically,
the
Arial
Black
font
should
display
correctly,
because
the
font
is
installed
in
both
operating
systems,
and
the
Home
Page
is
located
in
the
root
directory
of
each
operating
system
on
my
hard
drive
and
not
on
a
remote
server
or
Web
site.
How
do
I
get
Firefox
to
correctly
display
the
Arial
Black
font
in
the
browser
instead
of
substituting
Times
New
Roman
in
its
place?
When
I
open
the
custom
Home
Page
in
Edge,
Internet
Explorer,
and
Google
Chrome,
all
the
fonts
display
correctly.
What
is
it
about
Firefox
that
causes
it
to
not
detect
and
use
the
Arial
Black
font?
Arial
Black
is
one
of
of
the
default
fonts
contained
in
all
of
the
Windows
operating
systems
since
Windows
3.1.
Even
when
Windows
was
a
DOS
operating
system,
Arial
Black
was
one
of
the
fonts
included
in
the
operating
system's
font
directory.
I
am
including
two
screen
shots:
One
is
Mozilla
Firefox
browser
displaying
the
Home
Page
coded
for
Arial
Black
in
the
CVS
pharmacy
link.
The
second
is
from
Google
Chrome
displaying
the
same
Home
Page
on
the
same
hard
drive,
on
the
same
operating
system
(Windows
10
Pro,
64-bit).

Verizon
Wireless
Browser
Conflict
Issue
I
tried
to
log
into
my
Verizon
Account
today
using
v55.0.2
(64-bit)
on
a
MacBook
Pro.
I
got
a
message
attached
that
I've
never
seen
before.
I
was
able
to
login
via
other
browsers
(Safari
and
Chrome)
but
not
FireFox.
Tech
Support
at
Verizon
didn't
know
what
was
the
issue
either.
I
didn't
have
two
open
browsers
and
don't
use
Firefox
on
my
other
mobile
devices.
I
clean
the
Firefox
browser
cache
and
cookies
(I
removed
all
history)
and
still
get
the
same
screen.
What
might
be
the
problem
here
and
what
should
I
do?
Thank
you.
why

they

The

may

trying
to
add
https:
exception,
but
'no

I
have
a
server
on
my
lan
and
want
to
be
able
to
connect
via
https
for
dev
purposes.
I
created
a
self-signed
openssl
cert,
and
have
tried
to
create
an
exception
under
about:preferences#advanced...
but
when
I
try
to
add
an
exception,
it
fails
with
'no

I've
tried
using
the
local

(www),
the
fully-qualified

name
(www.local.lan),
and
the
ip
address
(192.168.0.96),

get
the
same
'no

each

Is
there
some
magic
I
need
to
do?
The

I
noticed
the
crashing
starting
right
about
when
I
found
some
suspicious
malware
on
my
computer.
I
removed
it
and
then
it
started
crashing.
I've
updated
my
drivers,
windows
etc
and
nothing
works.
I
have
a
few
tabs
open
and
it
suddenly
crashes,
every
one
of
them.
It
can
be
10
minutes
between
or
10
seconds.
How
do
I
fix
this?
Very
annoying,
cant
watch
streams
or
youtube
because
i
have
to
reload
the
tab
and
the
video
restarts.
This
happens
in

as
well,
and
i
have
followed
all
the
steps
on
your
'Firefox

page.
Since
the
latest
update
all
I'm
getting
on
one
regular
site
is
text

on

it
appears
normal.
I
have
a
string
of
web
pages
that
I
go
to
every
morning
and
evening
and
I
keep
them
stored
on
the
Bookmark's
toolbar
for
easy
access.
Since
the
latest
update
all
of
them
still
work
fine
except
one
-
every
time
I
go
to
it
all
I
see
is
text.
Yet
if
I
copy
the
web
address
and
paste
it
into
Chrome
it
shows
up
looking
the
same
as
ever,
so
obviously
something
in
your

is
having
issues
with
this

lonnic
PDF.js
viewer
problem?
I
haven't
posted
one
of
these
in
a
while.
But
here
it
goes!
One
of
the
websites
I
work
on,
the
page
has
5
embedded
re-direct
PDF's
that
open
upon
click.
I
refresh
the
page
trying
to
trigger
it
to
open,
and
once
it
happens.
I'm
not
sure
if
it's
a
load-time
error
or
not
that's
causing
it.
But
one
incident
of
refresh
makes
one
or
more
of
the
PDF's
links
to
open
in
new
tabs.
I've
searched
throughout
the
forums,
and
seen
a
couple
of
suggestions
with
About:config,
but
all
matched
mine.
I've
tried
doing
this
in

and
of
no
success
of
triggering
it
to
happen.
Any
suggestions
whether
it's
Domain-sided

Background
window
goes
blank
On
occasion,
when
switching
to
a
window
in
the
background,
that
window-which
may
have
had
one
or
multiple
tabs-has
gone
completely
blank,
with
just
the
red,
green,
yellow
buttons
in
the
upper
left
hand
corner.
Otherwise
the
page
is
completely
white.
Is
there
a
way
to
restore
that
window?
Why
the
master
password
window
is
opening
when
there
is
already
one?
Everytime
I
start
a
Firefox
window
the
first
time
there
is
a
certain
delay,
after
the
the
delay
Firefox
ask
me
for
my
master
password.
That's
fine!
But
if
I
start
Firefox
and
move
to
a
website
which
require
a
password
which
is
stored
in
the
Firefox
password
manager
before
the
end
of
the
delay,
Firefox
ask
me
instant
for
the
master
password.
The
problem
is,
if
I
start
to
enter
my
master
password
it
often
happens,
that
at
the
end
of
the
first
mentioned
delay
and
in
my
writing
process
a
second
window
with
the
master
password
opens.
Isn't
it
possible
to
deactivate
the
second
master
password
window
if
there
is
already
one?
Would
love
that
feature
and
would
improve
my
usability
experience.
Thank

I
can't
verify
my
account.
Firefox
sends
me
an
email
to
confirm
my
account,
BUT
there
is
no
link
in
the
email
to
click.
MY
Question
is
simple!
Why
is
there
not
a
link
in
the
dozens
of
confirmation
Emails
that
Mozilla
sends
me?
We
are
told
that
Mozilla
compatible
agent
traffic
in
Google
Analytic
reporting
is
100%
bot
driven
traffic.
Can
you
provide
any
info
contrary
to
this
notion.
I
have
clients
that
say
all
the
traffic
identified
under
browsers
in
Google
Analytics
as
Mozilla
Compatible
Agent
is
robotically
driven.
I
contend
that
a
decent
percentage
of
that
traffic
is
in
fact
solid
real
traffic
in
responding
to
our
email
broadcasts.
Can
you
cite
any
documentation
that
can
verify
a
portion
of
MCA
traffic
is
in
fact
real
or
please
point
me
to
any
further
documentation
on
this
issue.
Thanks,
Steve
Dickman
PS.
Also,
any
explanation
as
to
why
there
is
separate
Firefox
traffic
on
the
attached
report
in
addition
to,
but
separate
from
the
MCA
traffic
highlighted
here?
Why
don't
some
buttons
work
on
some
websites?
This
is
happening
more
and
more,
and
can't
seem
to
solve
the
problem
in
even
the
latest
Firefox
version
55,
even
turning
off
all
ad
blockers,
trackers,
turn
on
cookies
(in
Options,
Adblock
Plus,
Ghostery,
etc)
and
re-booting
with
all
these
things.
Just
today,
I
was
about
to
click
on
the
Complete
Transaction
button
in
my
Citibank
online
payment
after
all
functions
worked
fine
up
to
that
point,
and
then
nothing.
I
tried
to
listen
to
WBGO
radio
live
stream
and
where
before
the
button
would
show
up
to
click--now
even
that's
not
happening.
Same
thing
happens
on
more
and
more
vendor
shopping
carts.
But
if
I
go
to
Chrome,
then
everything
works
fine.
I
don't
want
to
go
to
Chrome
after
being
with
Firefox
since
it
began,
but
it's
getting
harder
and
harder
to
deal
with
this.
Today
I
'back-pedeled'
from
my
Firefox
55
64bit
and
changed
to
the
ESR
version
of
Firefox
that's
supposed
to
have
more
functionality
with
back-of-the-house
things
Firefox
says
it
has
eliminated,
but
this
isn't
helping
either.
I
don't
know
much
about
all
these
basic
--
what
are
they,
add-ons/ins?
--
like
Java,
Flash,
APIs,
etc,
but
I
kinda
suspect
Firefox
is
either
blocking
or
can't
handle
one
or
more
of
these.
Is
it
possible
to
setup
2FA
(two-factor
authentication)
for
your
Firefox
account?
I
would
like
to
make
it
so
that
logging
into
my
Firefox
account
required
2FA,
like
with
the
use
of
an
application
such
as
Authy.
I
have
a
firefox
profile
on
a
flash
drive.
how
do
I
restore
this
so
I
can
have
my
old
bookmarks
useable
again?
I
need
to
restore
my
firefox
profile
from
a

I
had

do
a
fresh
win

install
and
need
to
restore
my
old
profile
so
I
can
get
to
my
old

How
do
I
transfer
favorites
I
installed
Mozilla
Firefox
for
Windows
today,
switching
from
the
Edge
browser
from
Windows
10.
I
have
numerous
URL
saved
in
several
folders
in
my
Edge
favorites.
Is
there
a
way
to
automatically
copy
paste
them
in
Mozilla
or
do
I
really
have
to
do
that
one
item
at
a
time?
Thank
you!
Images
will
not
appear
in
Zooniverse.org
projects
with
FF
55.0.2
Zooniverse.org
hosts
a
variety
of
'citizen
scientist'
projects
that
range
from
transcription
to
listening
to
bat
noises.
Many
of
their
most
popular
projects
rely
on
images.
I'm
not
an
expert,
but
it
appears
that
the
latest
update
of
FF
has
screwed
something
up
with
the
'box'
that
contains
the
images
in
the
different
projects.
Some
Zooniverse
users
suggest
it
may
be
because
FF
is
causing
the
black
background
color
to
go
to
the
foreground
(I
don't
know,
which
is
why
I'm
asking).
A
small
fix
is
available
for
those
projects
that
utilize
the
'pan'
and
'zoom'
buttons
for
the
images
-
using
one
of
the
tools
will
show
the
image
in
the
box.
The
image
IS
there
-
I
left-clicked
'view
image'
in
a
seemingly
blank
box
and
was
rewarded
with
the
image
in
a
new
tab
.
.
.
but
that
does
nothing
to
fix
the
problem.
Apparently,
this
problem
started
with
the
new
incarnation
of
FF
-
and
it
doesn't
happen
in
Chrome,
which
means
that
FF
is
losing
users
to
that
browser.
Does
anyone
know
if
FF
intends
to
fix
this?
Thanks
for
any
help.
I
have
checked
'Remember
Logins
for
Sites
-
No
Exceptions,
but
Firefox
has
stopped
accepting
updates
to
passwords.
How
do
I
fix
this?
Recently,
I
was
forced
to
change
my
password
for
a
site
I
use
frequently.
I
clicked
on
Update
my
password
when
the
box
popped
up,
but
Firefox
will
NOT
update
my
password.
It
continues
to
insert
the
old
password
that
will
no
longer
access
the
site.
This
is
very
annoying.
How
do
I
get
it
to
work
again.
In
searching
for
an
answer,
I
saw
where
another
user
said
this
happened
to
them
when
Firefox
updated
to
a
new
version.
Perhaps,
there
is
a
bug
in
version
54?
Closing
a
few
tabs
does
not
slim
down
memory
usage
Firefox
55.0,
latest
Win
10:
Firefox
operates
properly.
HOWEVER,
by
chance,
using
Task
Manager,
I
noticed
that
when
I
close
a
few
tabs,
the
amount
of
memory
space
Firefox
uses
does
not
decrease.
If
I
close
Firefox
down
and
then
re-launch,
Task
Manager
does
show
that
Firefox
is
using
less
memory.
This
strikes
me
as
a
big.
Is
there
any
way
to
fix
this,
or

Suddenly
no
visual
difference
between
loaded
and
unloaded
tabs
Hi
I
have
a
large
number
of
tabs
that
gets
re-opened
every
time
I
open
Firefox,
but
each
tab
is
not
loaded
until
the
moment
I
click
on
it.
So
far,
it
has
always
been
possible
to
see
which
tabs
are
loaded
and
which
are
not,
but
in
the
last
few
days
it
looks
as
if
they
are
all
loaded.
That
is
very
inconvenient!
Is
it
an
error
in
the
new
version
of
Firefox
(I
use
v.55.0.2
64-bit)?
Normally
you
can
scroll
through
the
tabs
using
the
mouse
wheel,
but
that
does
not
work
either.
I
should
mention
that
I
have
Tab
Groups,
Tab
Mix
Plus,
Session
Manager,
NoScript
and
AdBlock
Plus.
I
have
used
them
for
several
years.
I
have
tried
to
delete
the
entire
cache
and
all
cookies
and
restart
windows
and
delete
the
places
database
AND
uninstall
and
reinstall
Firefox.
Nothing
helped.
All
help
is
very
much
appreciated
-
thank
you!
I've
tried
to
attach
a
screen
shot
to
this
message.
But
every
time
I
try,
Firefox
crashes
and
must
be
restarted,
so
it
simply
does
not
work.
(The
same
problem
occurred
at
http://forum.mozilladanmark.dk/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=12475
).
But
you
can
probably
imagine
a
lot
of
tabs,
which
should
have
2
different
colours,
but
all
of
them
look
the
same,
except
for
the
current
tab.

the

Everything

is
my

So,
can
you

this

the

one
that
followed.

It's
not

not
every

I
believe
it

with

Very
quickly
55.0.2
came
out
and
I
thought
ah-ha,
those
good
people
know
about
it

this
is
a
fix.
But
the

thing
still
happens.
Not

never

just
every

After

all
works
for

it
goes
again.

Why
FF

on

To
clarify,
I
don't
have
any
issue
on

or
during

Only
when
I
close
the
browser,
especially
after

I
see
that
it's
taking
up

50%
of

30-60

also
get
the

is

What

is
it
saving?
Yes,

months
ago.
Now,
when
I
click
a
link
in
Outlook
2007
or
Excel,
I
get
the
message
'this
operation
has
been
cancelled
due
to
restrictions
in
effect
on
this
computer.
Please
contact
your
system
administrator.'
I
have
Firefox
installed
and
all
its
defaults.
About
the
time
this
occurred,
I
had
uninstalled
and
reinstalled
Firefox
due
to
some
other
issues.
My
system
is
apparently
trying
to
launch
IE11
which
also
appears
not
to
be
installed
and
I
can't
find
a
solution
to
that
either.
Is
there
something
I
can
do
to
correct?
I
would
appreciate
it
very
much.
I
want
all
links
to
open
in
Firefox
and
the
heck
with
Microsoft
browsers.
Firefox
crashes
bp-548ff051-eb38-4c8a-b45f-66ba51170825,
when
open
firefox
it
showing
crash
reporter
ans
even
i
cant
open
it
as
safe
mode
too.
re
install
the
firefox
and
install
latest
version,
but
result
was
same.
trying
to
doing
system
restore
in
backdate
which
this
issue
not
existed
but
result
same.
I
will
not
able
to
more
than
2gb
file
download.
i
will
try
to
re-download
at
many
times
but
the

I
need
to
keep
my
cookies
for
duckduckgo.com
but
firefox
keeps
deleting
it
even
though
I
have
it
as
an
exception
to
allow?
I
hate
cookies.
However
I
need
my
duckduckgo.com
cookies
to
stay
set
as
'allow'
in
the
exceptions
box.
I
have
my
settings
so
everything
is
wiped
clean
when
I
exit
Firefox,
which
is
great,
except
for
the
duckduckgo
cookies.
I
have
to
reset
all
my
settings
on
duckduckgo
every
time
I
need
to
use
the
internet.
It
is
mind
boggling
....
I
have
been
working
on
correcting
this
for
some
time
now
but
I
am
at
a
loss.
Is
there
a
way
to
keep
the
duckduckgo
cookies
on
Firefox
and
not
any
others
when
I
quit
Firefox?
I
hope
this
does
not
sound
confusing...
but
it
sort
of
is..
bleh.
Thank
you
guys
for
any
help
you
may
have.
Ravyn
UWP
version
of
firefox
I
am
very
old
user
of
Firefox
and
using
it
since
2009,
and
i
am
also
responsible
to
making
people
use
to
of
Firefox.
and
i
am
using
win32
version
in
my
desktop
but
also
want
to
use
in
my
windows
tablet
and
mobile,
which
requires
store
UWP
version
of
Firefox,
please
make
UWP
version
of
Firefox
which
will
available
on
Mobile,Tablet,Laptop,Desktop
through
Microsoft
Store.
Alternately
you
can
use
Microsoft
Desktop
bridge
to
bridge
your
existing
Firefox
app
in
UWP.
'save
link
as'
does
nothing
Hi,
Whenever
I
right-click
on
a
link
to
a
file
(any
kind
of
file
-
.zip,
.pdf,
etc.),
and
select
'Save
link
as...'
nothing
happens.
It
does
not
pop
up
the
dialog
box
asking
me
where
to
save
the
file.
Based
on
a
Google
search
of
these
symptoms,
I
have
tried
the
following
to
no
avail:
-
disable
all
plugins
-
start
FireFox
in
safe
mode
-
clear
manually-set
options
in
about:config,
browser.download.*
-
temporarily
disable
the
firewall
(Windows
Defender,
not
Avast)
Left-clicking
on
the
links
works,
to
save
the
file
in
the
default
directory.
What
else
can
I
try?
Download
full
offline
version
54
Where
can
I
get
a
full
download
of
Firefox
version
54?
I
don't
want
the
latest
version
and
I'd
prefer
to
get
it
from
Mozilla
itself
to
avoid
relying
on
another
party.
Since
the
last
update
of
Firefox
a
lot
of
my
addons
don't
work
anymore.
Some
of
these
(security)
addons
are
of
greater
importance
to
me
than
any
security
issues
that
a
new
version
of
Firefox
might
fix.
Whenever
I
open
a
new
tab
It
opens
on
an
address
line
that
I
do
not
want.
How
do
I
change
it?

I
want
to
change
the
language
of
the
browser
to
English
I
tried
to
change
the
language
but
the
browser
itself
keeps
being
German,
I
can
only
set
my
preferred
languages
to
English
but
that
doensn't
change
anything,
neither
does
re-downloading
Firefox
nor
re-downloading
Firefox
in
English
-
the
browser
is
always
in
German
and
that's
annoying
because
then,
pages
like
airbnb
are
in
german
too.
Everything
else
on
my
mac
is
in
English.
There
is
a
Mozilla
HTML
doc
(0
bytes)
in
My
Documents
that
keeps
coming
back
no
matter
how
many
times
I
delete
it.
How
can
I
get
rid
of
it?

Thanks.
I
can
no
longer
access
sharepoint
from
firefox
I
have
looked
at
other
related
articles
and
tried
(to
the
best
of
my
ability)
to
follow
the
recommended
solution
but
alas
it
did
not
work.
Sharepoint
opens
with
chrome
without
difficulty,
I
have
also
re-installed
firefox.
I
can
login
to
my
microsoft
account
with
firefox
and
use
outlook
but
when
I
click
the
link
to
sharepoint
it
seems
to
go
round
in
circles.
It
just
flashes
and
keeps
saying
working....
Thank
you
for
your
advice
in
advance,

Hi
I
have
this
code
that
works
well
as
long
as
i
don't
add
or
remove
addon's
icons..
but
i
can't
always
tweak
it
till
it
fits
the

because
i
removed
or
added
a
new
addon's
icon..

I
need
the
navigation

submenu
to
follow
the
urlbar
at
the
same
exact
length.
My
css
is
just
adapted
to
the
number
of
icons
in
the
navigation
bar..
&
isn't
a
definitive
solution.
i'd
need
either
a
userscript
or
addon
if
it
exists.
i
doubt
a
userstyle
would
help..
but
why
not
if
the
urlbar
submenu
follows
the
length
of
the
urlbar
perfectly,
adding
or
removing
icons
too.

I've

years

and
I
feel
deeply
betrayed
that
a

I
have

continuously

often

is
apparently
doing
something
so
despicable.

Be
part
of
a
'global
elite'
society
that
is
in
control
of
the
world.
The
Illuminati
is
a
secret
society
that
began
under
the
direction
of
Jesuit
priests.
Later,
a
council
of
five
men,
one
for
each
of
the
points
on
the
pentagram,
formed
what
was
called
“The
Ancient
and
Illuminated
Seers
of
Bavaria.”
They
were
high
order
Luciferian
Freemasons,
thoroughly
immersed
in
mysticism
and
Eastern
mental
disciplines,
seeking
to
develop
the
super
powers
of
the
mind.
Our
sole
purpose
is
world
domination.
The
Illuminati
is
the
primary
motivational
forces
encouraging
global
governance,
a
one-world
religious
ethic,
and
centralized
control
of
the
world’s
economic
systems.
Organizations
such
as
the
United
Nations,
the
International
Monetary
FUND,
the
World
Bank,
and
the
International
Criminal
Court
are
tentacles
of
the
Illuminati.
Join
the
New
World
Order
(NWO),
an
extremely
powerful
and
influential
group
of
individuals
which
include
many
of
the
world's
wealthiest
people,
top
political
leaders,
and
corporate
elite,
as
well
as
members
of
the
so-called
Black
Nobility
of
Europe
(dominated
by
the
British
Crown)
create
a
One
World
Government,
stripped
of
nationalistic
and
regional
boundaries,
that
is
obedient
to
their
agenda.
'We

Why

Whenever

it
opens
up
on

and
I
have
to

Help!!!
Firefox
focus
stolen
under
Windows
10
A
while
ago,
I
aksed
a
question
regarding
focus
being
stolen
from
Firefox
under
Windows
10.
See:-
https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1154862
It's
taken
me
a
long
time
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
this
but
I
think
I've
finally
figured
it
out:-
What
happens
is
that
if
you
launch
Firefox
soon
after
initially
logging
into
Windows
10,
something
steals
focus,
often
while
the
user
is
in
the
middle
of
typing
something.
At
first
I
thought
this
problem
only
happens
with
Firefox.
However,
I
subsequently
discovered
it
also
happens
with
other
tasks/applications
launched
soon
after
logging
in
to
Windows.
The
problem
is
related
to
background
tasks
that
run
automatically
as
part
of
Windows
10
start
up.
If
any
task
in
the
Start-up
list
in
Task
Manager
requests
focus,
it
appears
that
Windows
10
allocates
focus
to
that
task,
irrespective
of
whether
or
not,
the
user
has
launched
another
application
in
the
foreground
that
currently
has
focus.
In
my
case,
the
offending
start
up
tasks
were
'AiChargerPlus'
and
'Sandboxie
Control'.
The
result
is
very
annoying.
As
far
as
I
can
tell
the
only
workarounds
are...
1)
Wait
for
all
start
up
tasks
to
complete
before
launching
any
application.
2)
Disable
all
tasks
in
the
start
up
list
that
take
focus
(This
may
not
be
possible
the
start
up
tasks
are
essential)
Is
there
a
better
solution?

It
may
be
a

because

Why
can
.log
files
not
be
opened
directly
in
the
browser
On
Linux
(Debian
8)
with
Firefox
55,
when
I
try
to
open
a
link
to
a
.log
file,
firefox
only
allows
me
to
open
the
file
with
an
external
viewer.
The
open
dialog
states
that
the
file
'build.16015.log'
is
of
type
'application
log'.
I
can
choose
to
open
the
file
with
GVim
or
to
save
it.
As
this
file
is
plain
text,
I
would
like
to
open
in
directly
in
firefox
(so
that
I
can
use
the
refresh
button
to
easily
see
updated
contents).
I
can
see
that
the
mime
type
definition
with
comment
'application
log'
is
in
/usr/share/mime/text/x-log.xml.
This
file
has
<code><mime-type
type='text/x-log'></code>
and
also
contains
<code>sub-class-of
type='text/plain'</code>
and
<code><glob
pattern='*.log'/></code>.
When
I
download
the
file
and
run
the
command
'file
--mime-type
-b
build.16015.log',
it
returns
'text/plain'.
Why
does
firefox
not
recognize
this
file
as
a
plain
text
file,
and
is
there
any
way
to
override
this?
Also,
while
troubleshooting,
I
installed
the
'Open
at
Text'
extension,
however
that
extension
still
does
not
allow
me
to
view
the
file
in
the
browser.

with
both
Windows

and
Windows

the

do

I
know
they
do
not

(wish
they

but
even
after
I
visit
the

the

show.
If
I
shutdown

and
reopen,

are
gone
again.
One

On

A

Now
when
I

I
get
an

saying
'Profile

I
have
deleted

re-downloaded

three

and
shut
down

I
combed
through
this

I
don't

I've

Unable
to
close
Firefox
after
latest
update
&
newest
version
of

26
NPAPI?
Firefox
updated
today.
Then
I
uninstalled
Adobe
add-in
which
had
been
disabled
by
Firefox
previously.
I
downloaded
&
installed
the
latest
version
of
Adobe
Flashplayer
(26.0.0.151),
which
Firefox
allowed
to
activate
just
fine.
I
later
tried
to
shutdown
Firefox
(File|
Exit)
and
was
unable
to
do
so;
clicking
the
X
in
upper
right
hand
corner
did
not
work
either.
I
used
Task
Manager
to
close
Firefox,
reopened
it
and
disabled
Flashplayer.
Firefox
still
wouldn't
close
normally.
I
then
loaded
Firefox
in
Safe
Mode
and
then
was
able
to
close
it
using
the
X
from
the
upper
right
hand
corner...
I
don't
think
Adobe
caused
the
problem,
but
I
was
able
to
exit
in
Safe
Mode,
which
turned
everything
off.
Prior
to
this
latest
Firefox
update
I
hadn't
had
any
problem
with
exiting
the
browser.
Obviously,
I
can't
keep
using
Task
Manager
to
exit
Firefox
all
the
time...
I'm
at
a
bit
of
a
loss
here.
why
does
google
change
moments
after
loading
a
search
result
I
do
not
know
if
this
is
a
Mozilla
fault
but
once
i
have
sent
a
google
search
then
moments
after
the
results
come
up
on
the
screen,
also
including
a
few
pictures,
the
whole
page
changes
and
looks
a
little
bit
Yahoo'ish.
I
don't
understand
why
the
page
does
not
stay
as
is
with
the
google
search
results.

New
Ad
Attack:
Long
URL
+
Audio
Pop-up
Lately
I've
found
a
new
'advertisement'
attack
to
firefox:
A
pop-up
opens
with
an
extremely
long
URL.
This
blocks
firefox
completely
until
I
force
close.
Meanwhile
they
introduce
an
audio
file
in
the
background
and
a
javascript
alert
with
a
telephone.
The
main
issue
is
not
the
ad
itself,
the
alert,
or
the
popup.
The
issue
is
that
they
are
exploiting
some
type
of
firefox
vulnerability,
that
blocks
the
whole
browser
intentionally.
It's
there
a
way,
to
stop
long
urls
from
loading?
Why
can't
I
connect
to
http://www.hospitalcomp
are.hhs.gov/
?
The
above
'address'
is
for
a
US
Government
/
Medicare
web
site.
I
understand
that
much
of
the
federal
government
is
in
turmoil
right
now,
but
is
it
reasonable
that
a
Medicare
site
would
be
improperly
configured
?
How
do
I
get
a
distributable
copy
of
Windows
32bit
Firefox
for
my
students
with
poor
internet
(who
will
run
their
lessons
off
a
pendrive.)
I'm
training
5,000
unemployed
youths
in
India
so
they
can
get
jobs.
Internet
in
many
regions
is
rubbish.
So
I
give
them
a
copy
of
my
webapp
with
all
their
lessons
on
a
pen
drive.
The
webapp
runs
nicely
with
Firefox.
(But
not
Chrome)
But
I
need
to
give
them
a
copy
of
Firefox.
So
where
do
I
get
a
master
distributable
copy?
Spontán
sokszorozódik
egy,
vagy
több
könyvjelző,
akár
1000-nél
is
több
lesz
belőlük.
Néhány
hónapja
tapasztaltam,
hogy
sokszorozódik
egy,
vagy
több
könyvjelzőm.
Nem
látok
összefüggést
a
használatukkal.
Most
éppen
egy
olyan
sokszorozódott,
amit
nagyon
ritkán
használok.
A
legnagyobb
gond
az,
hogy
eddig
a
törléssel
mindegyik
'klón'
törlődött,
de
most
csak
egyesével
tudnám
-
az
én
tudásommal
-
törölni.
Ráadásul
több
gépemen
is
jelentkezik
ez
a
probléma,
mert
gondolom
szinkronizálódnak
a
különböző
gépeken
futó
firefox-ok.
Előre
is
köszönöm
a
segítséget.

A

telling
me
to
go
to

(browser.newtab.url
replacement)
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/new-tab-override/.
I
do
that,

the

Firefox
ESR
52.3.0
and
Firefox
Android
did
only
sync
once,
8
days
ago.
Why?
I
have
had
Firefox
for
years
in
linux,
currently
Debian
Jessie.
8
days
ago
I
installed
Firefox
for
Android
to
my
phone
running
Marshmallow.
After
installing
I've
created
a
Firefox
Sync
account
on
linux
and
logged
into
it
from
Android.
All
the
bookmarks
got
transferred
to
Android
just
fine.
There
was
nothing
to
sync
back
because
installation
on
Android
was
new.
Since
then
(8
days
ago),
both
devices
report
that
they
are
connected
to
the
Sync
account.
But
nothing
is
synced.
Both
devices
report
that
there
are
2
devices
but
that
the
other
device
wasn't
online
for
8
days.
And
I've
got
mails
that
I
only
connected
one
device
(but
as
I
said,
the
account
shows
two
devices
connected
on
both
platforms).
What's
the
problem?
I
will
update
to
Debian
Stretch
soon,
will
a
new
desktop
Firefox
fix
the
thing
automatically?

I've
tried
to
fix
this
by
addressing
.parentlock
issue
through
console
and
also
by
removing
preference
files,
but
in
doing
so
the
latter,
lose
vital
info.
I
don't
have
much
experience
with
Terminal.
I
put
all
files
back
in
their
original
places
until
I
know
what
I'm
doing.
I've
also
read
we
can
turn
on
invisible
files
and
look
for
the
parentlock
file
that's
evidently
the
culprit.
No
luck
finding
that,
however.
It
sounds
like
there
are
different
options
to
fix
this
problem.
I'm
looking
for
the
safest!
Can
you
help
point
me
in
the
right
direction
we
don't
lose
our
bookmarks,

etc.?
Thanks

I

my

my

as
well.
During
the
installation,
we
had
an
error
at
the

-
mind
you,
it
wasn't
a
clean
install.
We
attempted
an
msoobe
through
the

which
failed
and
has
since
caused
a
vast
amount
of
errors
with
no
seemingly
easy
way
to
reverse
the
problem.
It
caused
a
glitch
with
the
anti-virus,
which
was
fixed
through
reinstallation,
but
ever
since
these
events,
firefox
has
not
been
able
to

anything.
No
updates,
no:
.mp3,

.msi,

etc.
I
can't
find
any
problem
with
my
anti-virus,
the
firewall
is
allowing
firefox
through;
Chrome
is
downloading
things
just
fine,
so
this
leads
me
to
believe
it
is
a
software
problem
with
firefox.
I
have

the
fixes
from
here:
https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/cant-download-or-save-files

suffice
to
say,
none
of
them
worked.
So

will
be
welcomed.

Changing
state
of
third-party
compositor
appears
to
crash
tabs'
rendering
engine
So,
I'm
using
Firefox
55.02-1
on
Linux
and
I've
noticed
an
issue
that
occurs
(I
don't
recall
it
ever
happening
in
previous
versions).
I'm
using
a
third-party
compositor
and
changing
its
state
appears
to
crash
gecko.
You
can
observe
what
I
mean
at:
https://vimeo.com/231154755
For
anyone
who
watched
that
video
and
believes
that
'killall
compton'
isn't
a
suitable
way
to
stop
compton:
there
isn't
really
a
way
to
stop
it.
It's
designed
to
be
a
daemon,
it
just
pipes
flags
to
the
daemon.
So,
even
'compton
-CG'
which
supposedly
stops
shadows
and
transparency
compositing,
cause
the
open
tabs
to
fail.
Granted,
you
could
argue
that
this
isn't
Firefox's
fault
but,
at
the
same
time,
Chromium
and
other
browsers
don't
crash
when
the
state
of
the
compositor
changes.
As
I
said,
this
didn't
happen
in
previous
versions
so
I'm
wondering
if
there
was
some
update
to
Firefox
that
causes
this
to
happen.
Is
there
any
debug
output/log
I
could
check
out?
I
know
this
issue
may
appear
quite
non-generic
in
the
sense
that
my
system
is
quite
heavily
customised
so
a
fix
might
not
be
possible
if
it
cannot
be
recreated
on
a
dev's
machine
so
I
was
wondering
if
you
guys
know
any
official
bug
report
platform
for
Firefox
beyond
this
forum
(or
if
similar
issues
have
been
reported
recently)?
I
inadvertently
removed
my
Tab
Group
list
from
'List
All
Tabs'
in
the
upper
right-hand
corner
just
above
'Menu'
and
can't
find
a
way
to
get
it
back.
I
inadvertently
removed
my
Tab
Group
list
from
'List
All
Tabs'
in
the
upper
right-hand
corner
and
can't
find
a
way
to
get
it
back.
I
updated
to
Firefox
Version
55.0.3.
That
didn't
correct
the
issue.
Instead
of
a
listing
of
my
(9)
tab
groups
with
a
name
for
each
one,
I
now
have
only
a
small
down
arrow
labeled
'List
All
Tabs.'
Right
clicking
on
this
arrow
brings
up
a
menu:
'Move
to
Menu,'
'Remove
from
Toolbar,'
'Menu
Bar,'
'Bookmarks
Toolbar,'
and
'Customize...'
None
of
these
when
selected
restores
by
tab
group
list.
Is
there
something
under
'Customize'
that
will
fix
this
problem?
The
only
way
I
can
now
get
from
one
group
to
another
is
to
left
click
the
aforementioned
down
arrow
and
select
'Tab
Groups.'
This
brings
up
a
full
screen
showing
all
of
my
groups
and
the
tabs
in
each.
I
can
then
select
a
tab
in
any
of
the
groups.
This
extra
step
shouldn't
be
necessary.
I'm
running
Windows
10
Pro,
Version
1703.
Any
help
will
be
much
appreciated.
How
do
I
select
several
tabs
at
once
and
move
to
second
monitor?
would
like
to
select
a
set
of
tabs
and
move
to
my
second
monitor
screen,
tried
control
click,
shift
click,
but
none
of
these
work...
thanks

How
do
I
access
the
back
button
history?
In
previous
version
of
Firefox
I
was
able
to
right
click
the
back
button
and
view
the
history
for
the
tab.
Now
right
clicking
does
nothing.
When
I
hover
over
the
back
button
it
says
'Pull
down
for
history',
but
pulling
down
with
the
left
or
right
button
held
does
nothing.
Long
clicking
all
does
nothing.
How
do
I
access
the
history
for
the
tab
from
the
back
button
now?
Is
there
an
about:config
I
can
change
to
revert
back
to
the
old
behavior
as
I'd
rather
not
have
to
pull
down
and
change
a
muscle
memory
I've
had
for
years.

Version
55.0.3
update,
everything
has
vanished
This
morning
Firefox
updated
itself
to
version
55.0.3.
After
it
finished
updating.
everything
appears
to
have
vanished.
All
my
bookmarks
are
gone,
when
I
go
to
restore
my
bookmarks
a
message
popups
saying
'Unable
to
process
the
backup
file',
my
addons
now
all
say
'Legacy',
my
themes
are
gone,
no
history
shows
up
when
I
search
for
anything
and
adding
new
bookmarks
don't
work
either.
I've
tried
restarting
my
computer,
reinstalling
firefox
and
even
refreshing
firefox
(I've
still
kept
my
old
profile).
Nothing
seems
to
be
working.
After
watching
anything
on
twitch.tv,
Firefox
stutters
every
few
seconds,
even
after
leaving
twitch.
As
the
title
describes,
every
time
I
watch
something
on
twitch.tv
(livestreams,
clips,
vods,
etc),
or
through
their
embedded
player
on
other
websites,
Firefox
begins
to
stutter
every
few
seconds.
This
continues
even
after
I
have
left
twitch.tv
or
left
the
page
with
the
embedded
twitch
player.
This
is
most
noticeable
when
scrolling
through
webpages
(scrolling,
scrolling,
PAUSE,
scrolling...)
but
also
when
clicking
hyperlinks
or
clicking
between
Firefox
tabs.
Currently,
to
'fix'
the
issue
I
have
to
restart
Firefox.
It
also
doesn't
seem
to
matter
how
long
I
have
been
browsing
for.
If
I
watch
twitch
content
within
the
first
few
minutes
of
opening
Firefox
it
still
stutters.
Firefox
just
updated,
now
I
cannot
access
some
parts
of
websites.
Tells
me
that
I
am
using
firefox
inprivate
browsing
-
but
I
am
NOT!
I
have
double
checked,
and
triple
checked.
I
have
cleaned
the
cache.
I
still
cannot
access
pasrt
of
a
website
I
use
to
earn
extra
money.
It
tells
me
that
I
am
using
inprivate
browsing...
But
I
have
never
used
this!
Where
can
I
download
the
previous
version
since
this
one
will
not
allow
me
to
use
websites
that
have
ads
or
play
videos?

cannot
export
of
backup
bookmarks
I
recently
had
a
power
failure,
which
meant
that
Firefox
didn't
close
down
properly
when
the
PC
powered
down.
When
I
restarted,
Firefox
had
lost
all
of
my
previous
settings,
ie
bookmarks,
passwords
etc,
so
I
have
tried
to
recreate
a
profile
which
contains
all
of
the
previous
elements.
However,
there
is
clearly
something
wrong
&
although
I
have
deleted
the
places
files
&
run
the
'Refresh
Firefox'
utility,
these
continue.
My
main
bugbear
at
present
is
that
I
cannot
either
backup
my
bookmarks
file,
or
export
it
in
HTML
format,
in
order
to
even
consider
creating
a
brand
new
profile.
I
have
also
noticed
that
my
new
profile
has
a
bookmarksbackup
folder,
but
is
never
getting
populated
with
any
content.
I
do
have
an
old
profile
which
I
have
used
to
recreate
the
profile
that
I
am
using
now,
but
I
am
beginning
to
wonder
whether
there
is
some
sort
of
corruption
in
the
files
contained,
which
means
that
I
am
simply
recreating
the
problems,
over
again.
I
have
a
number
of
other
quirks
&
eccentricities,
ie
the
clear
downloads
button
doesn't
always
work
&
all
of
the
small
icons
on
my
bookmarks
have
disappeared
&
show
no
sign
of
refreshing,
even
though
a
week
has
elapsed
since
the
original
'crash'.
So,
are
there
other
files
that
I
need
to
delete
/
recreate
in
my
profile,
in
order
to
get
back
to
normal
functionality
??
As
I
say,
my
biggest
current
problem
is
not
being
able
to
backup
or
export
my
current
bookmarks
file
-
it
says
that
it
is
being
done,
but
no
files
are
actually
created.
Oh,
and
I
can
create
new
bookmarks,
but
once
again,
the
small
icons
which
use
to
be
created,
no
longer
appear.
Many
thanks
for
any
assistance
out
there.
After
upgrading
to
macOS
Sierra
and
fresh
installation
of
Firefox,
when
I
sign
in
to
sync,
none
of
my
sync
data
appears???
I
just
formatted
my
MacBook
and
did
a
clean
install
of
macOS
Sierra.
I
was
signed
into
Firefox
sync
in
mac
OS
El
Capitan,
so
when
I
downloaded
and
installed
Firefox,
signed
in
to
sync,
I
would
of
expected
all
my
bookmarks
and
preferences
to
appear
momentarily,
as
the
Firefox
pop-up
suggested
after
I
signed
in.
I
only
use
Firefox
on
one
device,
so
there's
no
issues
there.
I
did
come
across
a
thread
here
somewhere
that
suggested
deleting
the
Firefox
app,
re-downloading
it
and
reinstalling
it
and
signing
into
sync,
which
I
just
did
and
I
still
get
the
top
right
hand
pop-up
telling
me
that
Firefox
will
begin
syncing/downloading
momentarily,
then
nothing.
When
i
backed
up
my
data
stored
in
my
home
folder,
I'm
assuming
there
is
not
a
local
bookmarks
file
for
Firefox?
I'm
worried
that
my
Firefox
sync
data
isn't
on
the
Firefox
servers
-
is
there
a
way
to
check
this
out
at
all?
What
could
be
causing
this?
and
more
importantly,
how
do
I
fix
this?

Why
does
Mozilla
want
to
alienate
its
users?
For
years
Firefox
has
been
losing
user
support
since
2010,
and
as
a
loyal
customer
I
have
persevered,
but
finally
they
have
placed
the
last
nail
in
their
coffin
with
me.
I
installed
the
latest
(55.0.3)
and
found
that
even
though
I
have
'restore
tabs
from
last
time'
set
that
it
doesn't.
Like
most
people
I
know,
I
keep
lots
of
tabs
open
on
what
I'm
currently
working
on
and
when
I
restart
they're
all
there.
Now
with
this
latest
'Improvement'
I
suddenly
get
a
whole
lot
of
tabs
that
have
no
URL
associated
with
them.
I
have
had
features
that
I've
I've
used
in
the
past
that
were
removed
without
warning,
but
this
one
renders
the
browser
useless,
quite
apart
from
the
fact
that
I've
now
lost
all
of
that
work
so
I
have
decided
to
switch
to
Chrome,
because
at
least
Google
is
interested
in
customer
satisfaction.
Anyhow,
my
question
is
'Why
does
Mozilla
want
to
alienate
its
users?'
I
will
certainly
no
longer
use
it,
they're
(the
Mozilla
team)
dead
to
me.
Favicon
stopped
working?
Hi
there.
Ive
been
using
favicon
for
ages
to
customize
my
bookmarks.
See,
i
have
many
bookmarks
on
my
toolbar,
many
of
them
from
the
same
site(reddit
mostly).
So
i
must
have
a
custom
icon
for
everything.
2
days
ago
only
1!!
of
the
icons
stopped
showing.
Today(which
Firefox
updated
to
55.0.3)
all
of
the
custom
icons
where
reset.
Any
idea
why?
Did
the
add
on
stopped
working
with
this
version
and
if
yes,
what
can
i
do
to
change
my
bookmarked
icons?
The
weirdest
part
in
all
of
this
is,
that
when
i
go
to
the
site
besides
its
name
i
CAN
see
my
custom
icon...I
will
add
an
image
so
you
can
understand
better.
I
hope
this
is
solvable,
i
love
Firefox
and
i
don't
want
to
switch
browsers.
Firefox

A

I
need
a

to

the

width
of
firefox
by

the
space
is
too
important
in
width
for
small

Why
do
I
get
'Setup
timeout
error:

longer
than
30
seconds

when
trying
to
view
the
National
Zoo
panda
cam?
I
used
to
be
able
to
watch
the
National
Zoo
panda
cam
for
years
-
https://nationalzoo.si.edu/webcams/panda-cam.
About
April
it
stopped
working.
It
worked
for
2
days
earlier
this
week
(8/23-24/17)
until
I
installed
the
latest
Firefox
update.
Why
can't
I
see
the
cams
any
longer
on
this
website.
I
get
this
error
on
many
websites;
videos
won't
load
or
won't
play.
This
same
error
also
stops
videos
on
the
CNN.com
website,
which
is
actually
appreciated.
I
did
try
turning
off
the
IPv6
-
that
did
nothing
for
me
with
this
problem.
I
am
running
Windows
7,
my
computer
is
within
4
years
old,
no
problems
seeing
the
other
panda
cam
pages
from
the
San
Diego
Zoo
or
Zoo
Atlanta.
It
seems
this
site
is
unable
to
upload
my
screenshot
of
the
page
and
error
message.
Bummer!
THANK
YOU
for
all
your

My
processor
spikes
using
web
content
on
my
MacBook
Pro
-
after
2
months
of
trying
to
fix,
Apple
Engineers
want
me
to
contact
MOzilla
to
tell
them
how
to
fix
I
have
a
recently
purchased
MacBook
Pro
2015.
Since
purchasing,
I
have
had
CPU
spikes
using
Firefox
and
Chrome
browsers
when
on
Yahoo,
particularly
when
running
videos
in
news
stories.
Activity
Monitor
will
rise
to
over
100%
and

gets
so
loud
I
can't
use
my
computer.
I
have
worked
with
Apple
for
the
past
9
weeks
to
try
to
resolve,
telling
them
that
I
do
not
have
this
problem
on
any
other
Apple
product
I
currently
use
or
have
ever
used
since
1987,
including
my
last
Mac
Book
Pro
(2011)
and
my
MacBook
Air
at
work.
It
is
clearly
something
specific
about
*this*
computer,
but
after
2
months
of
trying
everything
Apple
has
walked
me
through
--
including
having
hardware
tested
at
Apple
Store,
wiping
computer
clean,
re-installing
operating
system,
resetting
PRAM
and
SMC,
all
sorts
of
Firefox
settings
tweaks
(including
Hardware
Acceleration
on
and
off),
telling
me
to
use
Safari
instead
(I
don't
like
Safari
and
do
not
want
to
use,
though
I
tested
it
and
don't
have
this
problem
using
Safari,
but
DO
have
it
using
Chrome
as
well),
making
videos
and
uploading
files
to
Apple
engineers
--
Apple
doesn't
know
how
to
fix
this.
They
said
my
next
step
is
to
contact
Mozilla
and
have
Mozilla
tell
me
what
the
Apple
engineers
need
to
do
to
solve
this
problem.

How
i
rectify
this?
How
can
I
access
Last
Pass
since
the
newest

FF
just
updated
1/2

and
now
I
can't
access
Last

and
don't
know
any
of
my
passwords
to
get
to
any
site.
What
happened
and
how
can
I
fix
this?
At
this
point
I
can't
even
use
the
internet.
Thank
You
for
any
help,
I
was
able
to
transfer
all
my
'bookmarks'
from
my
old
computer
to
my
new
one.
How
do
I
now
transfer
all
the
'overflow'
bookmarks
(next
to
the
scroll
bar)?
(The
'overflow'
bookmarks
being
those
that
don't
fit
in
my
bookmarks
bar
at
the
top
and
are
stored
in
a
fly-out
pane
on
the
right
side.)
Can
I
turn
OFF
the
search
dropdown?
I
recently
had
to
reformat
my
computer
and
re-install
Firefox.
I
notice
that
when
I
type
in
the
address
bar
to
go
to
a
site
like
msn.com
it
drops
down
a
search
bar
suggesting
that
I
search
with
my
default
search
engine.
Well
I
know
where
I
am
going!!!
I
have
turned
OFF
suggested
sites,
yet
it
still
drops
down
a
search
bar
below
my
address
bar.
Can
I
turn
this
off?
It
is
distracting
and
annoying.
Why
does
Cisco
AnyConnect
VPN
with
Firefox
block
connection
to
all
google
sites?
I
must
use
Cisco
AnyConnect
for
remote
connection
to
my
university
library
-
which
I
use
often.
When
I
have
the
VPN
on
I
cannot
connect
to
any
google
resources
-
search,
images,
books,
scholar,
even
other
websites
that
use
google
fonts
-
spinning
rainbow
and
failure
is
the
result
-
almost
without
exception.
I
tried
removing
all
extensions
-
problem
persists.
I
tried
running
the
VPN
on
Safari
and
on
Chrome
-
no
problems
whatsoever,
they
work
fine.
I
want
to
keep
using
Firefox
because
Safari
oten
crashes
and
Chrome
spies
on
me.
Independently
of
that,
turning
the
VPN
off:
google
books
is
defective
under
Firefox
-
the
page
loads
-
but
the
text
of
the
book
does
not
load
-
stalls
forever.

How

I
have
a

which
won't

under

asterisk
with

where
is
it
saving
the

Nothing
happens
when

Firefox's
latest
and
greatest
64-bit
Firefox
(54.02
I
believe)
to
Firefox
52.3.0
ESR
64-bit.
Now
I
have
this
new
screenshot
button
that
I've
never
seen
before.
I
can't
figure
out
where
it's
saving
the
screenshots
or
if
it
even
works
and
no
save
dialog
is
ever
presented
when
I
left-click,
left-click
and
hold,
nor
right
click
on
the
button.
I'm
very
familiar
with

have
been
using

from

Martin
the
Firefox
updated
itself
and
then
removed
itself
from
my
computer.
Is
this
fixable?
This
morning
Firefox
updated
itself.
When
I
exited
Firefox
the
desktop
icon
was
gone,
the
program
was
removed
from
my
start
menu
&
it
seemingly
has
removed
itself
from
my
computer.
All
of
my
bookmarks
from
my
last
back
up
are
lost.
I
am
running
Windows
7
Professional.
Is
this
fixable?
If
I
just
reinstall
Firefox
from
the
website
I
am
going
to
lose
my
bookmark
info.
Mouse
wheel
scrolling
stop
working
for
a
while
if
touchpad
is
enabled
I
am
using
ThinkPad
T470s
with
KDE
Plasma
5
on
openSUSE
Tumbleweed
(almost
always
the
latest
snapshot).
The
mouse
wheel
scrolling
feature
intermittently
stops
working
for
a
while
if
the
touchpad
is
enabled.
This
has
happened
to
Firefox
ESR
version
52,
and
Firefox
54
and
55.
So
it
has
been
a
long
time
and
I
am
getting
to
know
how
to
minimise
the
annoyance.
When
the
mouse
wheel
scrolling
not
working,
it
cannot
scroll
the
webpage
up
and
down,
as
well
as
the
tabs
list
on
the
tab
bar.
However,
the
left
and
right
buttons
work
well
and
mouse
wheel
works
fine
in
other
windows
such
as
Dolphin
and
Kate.
Then,
if
using
the
touchpad
instead
to
perform
a
two-finger
scrolling,
the
scroll
speed
is
much
slower
than
normal,
and
it
gets
slow
and
slow
in
the
following
less-than-a-minute
time.
Then
the
touchpad
two-finger
scroll
stops
working,
too.
After
a
while,
approximately
several
minutes,
both
the
mouse
wheel
scrolling
and
the
touchpad
two-finger
scrolling
get
back
to
normal.
But,
when
the
the
mouse
wheel
scrolling
stops
working,
if
I
disable
the
touchpad,
then
it
gets
normal
almost
immediately.
So,
the
questions
are,
1.
Has
anyone
else
runs
into
this?
2.
What
is
the
problem
and
how
to
fix
it?
3.
If
no
one
knows
why
and
no
other
person
has
it,
how
do
I
debug
this?
Maybe
another
thing
I
should
mention
is
that
I
refreshed
my
Firefox
55.0.1
the
night
before
yesterday.
It
still
has
this
issue
even
under
such
a
fresh
state
without
any
custom
setting
and
add-on.
Any
help
is
appreciated.

a

the

I

then
the

Nothing

I
expected

now

the

appears
in

popup
On
my

page
(

I
have
a

to
a
popup,
which
is
'imported'
from
a

file
(Photos_popup.js)
Click
the
'Click

line
beneath
the
row
of
years
in
the
'Photos

box
to
see
the
pop-up
(I
had
to
disable
the

pop-up
blocker
(Tools)
option
to
display
it).
For
some
reason,
Firefox
prepends
the
word
'write'
at
the
top
of
the
popup
(see
image).
No
other
functionality
is
affected,
and
it
displays
just
fine,
otherwise.
Neither
Explorer
nor
Edge
do
this.
I
have
no
other
browsers
to
test
it
with.
My
target
audience
prefers
Firefox,
but
the
site
was
originally
designed
for
Explorer.
I
did
my
best
to
accommodate
both,
but,
obviously,
something
is
different
between
the
two.
I
never
noticed
this
issue
during
my
tests,
although
I
haven't
checked
it
in
years.
The
code
is
about
10
years
old,
and
rarely
changes.
My
recent
changes
were
attempted
'fixes'
for
this
issue,
but
which
changed
absolutely
nothing.
Style
issues
aside
(no
snarky
comments
about
my
stone
age
code,
thank
you
very
much!),
;)
can
anyone
see
a

for
this
happening
and
recommend
a
simple
fix?

Restored
tabs
blank
after
starting
Firefox
(v55.0.3
and
newer
versions)
I've
read
this
problem
in
some
similar
threads,
but
I
think
it's
not
exactly
the
same
issue.
I
updated
to
v55.0.3
a
couple
of
hours
ago
(I
do
not
recall
which
version
I
had
before).
I
had
41
opened
(kind
of
important)
tabs,
and
after
updating,
all
of
them
(BUT
the
first
and
the
last
one)
appeared
blank.
No
title,
and
no
content
when
I
tried
to
open
them.
I
chose
to
update
because
I
had
an
issue
of
not
being
able
to
create
new
bookmarks
(I
have
not
searched
yet
about
this
issue).
Restoring
(renaming)
recovery.js
and
so
on
did
nothing:
I
kept
getting
blank
tabs
every
time
I
started
Firefox.
Then,
I
found
the
file
containing
the
automatic
tabs
backup
when
updating,
opened
it
in
Firefox
as
a
.json
file,
copied
MANUALLY
every
one
of
the
41
URLs
and
reopened
every
single
one
of
them...
Even
the
bug
of
not
being
able
to
create
new
bookmarks
was
fixed!
However,
when
I
restarted
Firefox,
the
tabs
were
blank
again...
I
found
out
this
would
happen
with
every
new
tab
restored.
I
tried
updating
to
v56,
same
problem.
I
installed
v54
and
this
problem
was
gone.
But
the
bookmarks
bug
was
there
again,
haha
(I'll
google
about
it
right
now,
but
the
one
that
worries
me
the
most
is
the
blank
tabs
bug)...
Any
ideas?
Thank
you
in
advance!
How
to
put
a
web
page
on
my
desk
top
Just
want
to
save
web
sites
on
desk
top
for
easy
access
I
want
my
bookmarks
sidebar
to
display
permanently
Firefox
updated
today
and
now
my
bookmarks
sidebar
doesn't
display
permanently.
I
used
to
have
an
addon
called
sidebar
auto
show/hide
that
did
the
trick
for
the
previous
version
but
it's
not
working
for
this
one.
If
somebody
could
suggest
either
a
fix
or
a
browser
similar
to
firefox
please.

Only
the

The

Video
brightness
changes
when
moving
browser
window
to

display
When
moving
the
browsers
window
in
which
a
video
is
playing
to
the
second
display,
the
videos
brightness
or
gamma
changes.
This
results
in
a
too
bright
video
on
my
second
display.
When
moving
it
back
to
the
first
display
it
changes
back
(to
normal).
If
the
video
is
paused
it
does
not
change
brightness.
But
as
soon
as
you
resume
it
the
brightness
changes.
Only
the
brightness
of
the
video
changes
not
of
the
whole
site.
This
happens
only
if
using
a
HTML5
video
player.
When
using
flash
it
does
not
happen.
This
happens
only
in
firefox,
other
browser
do
not
behave
like
this.
I
noticed
this
first
after
the

was
today.

Hello
Before
some
time
I
used
to
search
on
your
URL
and
was
directed
on
to
google
search
results.
But
for
the
past
1
month,
I
am
redirected
to
yahoo.
I
really
hate
yahoo
and
just
wanted
google
to
be
my
search
partner.
I
studied
your
procedures
also
but
none
of
them
are
actually
working
for
me.
I
have
tried
every
possible
way
from
my
end.
When
I
make
a
search,
first
of
all,
it
shows
Google
in
the
URL
but
after
seconds
it
changes
and
the
search
results
are
actually
given
by
Yahoo.
Please
help
me
with
it
ourelse
I
have
to
switch
browser
and
I
really
dont
want
to
it.
Bookmarks
disappeared,
tried
various
suggested
fixes,
none
worked.
Unless
I
can
repair
this,
I
will
not
longer
use
Firefox.
I
have
tried
to
use
the
restore
function
to
get
the
bookmarks
back,
but
I
get
the
reply
'unable
to
process
the
backup
file.'
I've
tried
several
backups,
but
get
the
same
message
every
time.
I
tried
to
delete
the
'places.sqlite'
file
as
instructed
by
some,
but
this
did
nothing
to
restore
my
bookmarks.
I
cannot
open
the
places.sqlite
file,
either.
It
may
be
set
for
'read
only,'
but
I
did
nothing
to
set
it
that
way.
But
there
is
no
way
to
tell,
since
I
cannot
open
the
file.
What
I
need
to
do
is
be
able
to
restore
all
my
bookmarks
in
Firefox
and
I
need
precise
instructions
on
how
to
do
that.
As
I
said,
the
methods
I
listed
above
didn't
work
at
all.
I
am
using
Firefox
version
55.0.3
64-bit
edition
in
windows
10.
Any
help
would
be
appreciated.
But
if
I
cannot
restore
the
bookmarks,
I'm
afraid
this
will
be
the
end
of
my
long
relationship
with
Firefox,
since
I
would
have
to
consider
it
extremely
unstable
if
this
cannot
be
corrected.
How
to
restore
page
caching
behavior
after
upgrading
from
45.0
I
have
been
using
Firefox
v45.0
for
quite
a
long
time,
and
decided
to
try
out
a
newer
version
recently.
Currently
I
have
upgraded
to
a
slightly
old
version,
Nightly
55.0a1
(2017-05-24)
(64-bit).
After
the
transition
I
noticed
that
some
of
the
pages
that
were
being
cached
(in
memory)
by
default,
were
no
longer
getting
cached.
For
example,
I
am
using
the
mobile
Gmail
site
(https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/x/a),
where
the
pages
opened
during
the
current
FF
session
remain
in
cached
(possibly
only
in-memory)
until
FF
is
shut
down
(so
that
I
can
simply
place
FF
in
offline
mode
and
browse
through
the
Gmail
pages
I
had
opened
during
that
session
by
clicking
through
the
browser
history).
However
in
the
latest
versions
I
get
an
'offline
mode'
error
when
doing
this.
Even
if
I
simply
open
https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/x/a,
place
the
browser
in
offline
mode
right
after
that
(without
closing
the
tab)
and
refresh
the
tab,
I
get
the
'offline
mode'
error
(meaning
that
absolutely
no
attempt
is
made
by
the
browser
to
cache
the
page
content
in
memory).
I
also
tried
the
57.0a1
Nightly
from
08/24/2017
(3
days
ago),
and
observed
the
same
behaviour.
Also
it
seems
that
there
are
other
sites
affected
by
the
same
behaviour,
e.g.
Google
Docs,
https://0.facebook.com/home.php
(which
is
also
a
mobile
site),
while
caching
is
working
perfectly
for
other
sites,
e.g.
this
Mozilla
Support
site,
Firefox
Addons
site
(https://addons.mozilla.org),
Google
Search,
StackExchange
sites
range
(StackOverflow
etc).
I
would
like
to
know
if
there
is
a
way
to
restore
the
old
behaviour
(of
caching
all
opened
pages,
at
least
in
memory
during
the
browser's
runtime).
At
the
moment
I'm
unable
to
attach
any
diagnostic
information
(I
am
posting
this
via
Google
Chrome,
as
FF
does
not
allow
me
to
create
an
account
during
the
posting
process--it
simply
throws
a
403
error
with
'Access
denied'
and
'You
do
not
have
permission
to
access
this
page.'
error
messages)
as
soon
as
try
to
submit
the
account
creation
form).
However
I
can
provide
any
required
information
once
I
post
this
(assuming
I
can
get
this
through
:)
)
Also,
please
advise
if
this
question
is
out
of
scope
for
the
Mozilla
Support
site
(i.e.
if
I
need
to
migrate
this
to
MozillaZine
or
Bugzilla).
How
can
I
turn
off
one
feature
of
McAfee
WebAdvisor?
I
want
to
turn
off
the
Interest-Based
Ads
feature
of
McAfee
WebAdvisor.
McAfee
tech
support
told
me
to
find
WebAdvisor
on
my
Firefox
browser
and
go
to
Options/Settings/Interest-Based
Ads
(turn

off).
How
do
I
get
there?
If
I
find
WebAdvisor
through
the
Firefox
3-bar
Add-Ons/Extensions,
I
get
only
the
option
of
disabling
the
whole

Please

Fix?
Explained
pretty
much
as
above.
Using

64bit
and
updated
from
FF
54.01
to
FF
55.0.3
The

pane
only
has
this
problem,
not
the
initial
add

start
panes.
The
pane,
which
starts
reduced
sized
by
default,
is
missing
the
top
area
of
the
pane
leaving
a
plain
blank
white
empty
space,
almost.
In
fact
the
minimize,
resize
and
exit
buttons
are
there
if
you
hover
the
cursor
over
the
top
right
area.
You
can
then
see
three
very
small,
thin
grey
outlined
vertical
bars,
barely
separated
which
correspond
to
those
functions.
The
rest
of
the
top

are
shown
although
previously
they
would
display
very
differently
(see
attached

The
whole

pane
is
also
fixed
in
place,
you
can't
move
it
about
the
screen
with
the
mouse
at
all.
Tried
rebooting
FF
and
disabling/re-enabling
the

etc:
problem
persists.
Eventually
I
used
a
restore
point
and
went
back
to
FF

and,
as
hoped,
DTA
works
and
displays
correctly
again.
No

or
other

How

bars

them
back
to

missing
refresh
and
stop
buttons
since
upgrade
yesterday
Hi
Friends,
I
had
to
install
something
special
(quite
some
time
ago)
to
be
able
to
have
a
bigger
refresh
button,
and
also
the
X
or
stop
button,
which
I
had
placed
between
the
address
field
and
the
search
field,
in
my
toolbar.
With
the
upgrade
yesterday,
they
have
disappeared.
(The
Home
button,
which
was
to
the
right
of
Stop
and
Refresh,
is
still
there.)
I
opened
the
Customize
window,
to
try
and
replace
them.
But
they
aren't
there
anymore.
I
think
what
I
had
to
install
was
Classic
Theme
Restorer
(although
I'm
not
positive).
I
see
that
it
has
an
update
available.
Since
I
always
hesitate
to
install
upgrades
(especially
with
Firefox)
(guess
why)
can
you
tell
my
if
upgrading
it
will
get
them
back?
Or
else
what
can
I
do
to
get
those
vital
buttons
back?
(yes,
I
can
see
the
tiny
refresh
button
(barely),
but
I
need
a
larger
one,
also
like
having
the
stop
button)
Windows

See
additional
info
below.
Can
provide
screenshot
if
necessary.
Thank
you
very
much
Edit
Oops,
this
might
be
a
nevermind.
I
see
the
tooltips
for
both
buttons
are
still
there.
The
mousing
over
where
the
Refresh
button
is
suppose
to
be,
I
see
the
square
highlight
of
the
button....
Hah!!
I'm
not
positive,
but
I
think
the
buttons
still
work.
They're
just
missing
their
icons!!
I'd
like
to
keep
this
open
to
give
me
time
to
test
that
they
buttons
are
actually
working.
Refresh
seems
to
work,
but
I'm
not
positive.
But
as
soon
as
I'm
sure
they
work,
I'll
come
and
close
this
topic
(mark
solved,
whatever).
I'll
leave
it
to
someone
else
to
make
a
bug
report,
if
it
is
needed
:-)

Best
alternative(s)
to
FireFTP?
I
really
like
using
FireFTP.
However,
since
it
won't
be
compatible
with
Firefox
57
in
Nov
2017,
what
is
the
best
alternative(s)?
UPDATE:
I
tried
using
four
free
alternative
FTP
clients
today:
ClassicFTP,
WinSCP,
Cyberduck,
FileZilla.
My
first
choice
(and
one
I
will
be
using)
is
ClassicFTP
because
of
its'
simplicity
and
similarities
to
FireFTP.
My
second
choice
would
be
WinSCP.
The
other
two
have
lots
of
extras
that
I
don't
need
and
thus
make
them
more
complicated
to
use.
Below
is
a
May
9,
2017
post
by
Mime
Cuvalo,
who
designed
FireFTP,
about
the
'legacy'
of
FireFTP.
It
can
be
found
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
at:
https://github.com/mimecuvalo/fireftp/issues/192
mimecuvalo
commented
on
May
9,
2017:
'Development
on
FireFTP
is
slowing
down
since
Firefox
is
dropping
support
for
it
in
version
57
later
in
the
year.
Hence,
motivation
for
working
on
it
isn't
the
highest
currently.
I'll
probably
be
porting
FireFTP
at
least
to
PaleMoon
so
that
the
extension
survives.
Cheers!

Since
the
last
update,
when
using
'Open
All
in
Tabs'
for
a
group
of
tabs,
it
loads
them
all
in
reverse
order.
For
me,
that's
unacceptable.
Has
anyone
else
had
this
problem
and
has
anyone
found
a
way
to
correct
it?
Other
than
rearranging
all
of
them?
I
don't
really
want
to
go
back
to
an
older
version,
but
that
may
be
my
only
option.
I
chose
your
browser
because
it
was
the
best,
but
I
play
facebook
games
and
there
was
a
web
page
to
look
at
and
saying
there
are
asking
a
lease,
no
money
for
it
I
played
my
games
in
facebook
as
usual,
but
last
night
when
I
got
in
cookie
jam
it
was
telling
me
to
click
on
a
the
developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox/Releases/55
...I
did
click
on
the
address
and
it
brought
me
to
a
contract
for
a
lease...always
thought
Firefox
was
free
and
that
is
why
I
chose
Firefox
as
a
browser
and
until
now
it
worked
fine...I'm
not
at
an
age
to
start
paying
for
playing...would
you
explain
this
to
me...I
want
to
play
my
games
quietly
and
surely
with
friends
like
I
did
for
the
past
year.
Is
there
someone
to
answer
my
question
and
get
an
answer
that
will
please
me??
Thank
you
for
your
time...Marie-Denise

Having
issues
with
trying
to
get
the
gray
padlock
with
yellow
triangle
to
go
to
green
padlock
When
I
play
the
Miniclip
8
ball
pool
game,
the
padlock
is
gray
with
the
yellow
triangle
covering
it.
I
tried
installing
the
Unity
Web
Player
as
someone
else
in
a
Firefox
forum
suggested,
and
that
changed
the
padlock
to
green,
UNTIL
today
when
it
was
back
to
the
gray
padlock.
I
looked
at
the
Unity
Player
details
and
it's
only
good
up
to
Windows
8;
I
have
Windows
10.
I
uninstalled
Unity,
as
I
don't
think
it
works
for
W10.
I
have
tried
the
'about:config'
trick,
changing
the
'security...etc'
setting
to
true
from
false;
that
does
not
help
now.
I
am
at
my
wits
end,
because
I
enjoy
playing
that
pool
game,
and
with
the
gray
padlock/yellow
triangle,
it
affects
the
play
of
the
game
very
badly.
Any
suggestions
&
help
is
greatly
appreciated

about:config
browser.fullscreen.animateUp
has
no
effect
My
original
problem:
I
wanted
to
stop
the
molasses-like
animation
pulling
the
browser
tabs
and
navbar
off
screen
when
I
press
F11.
Unrelated
to
the
fade-in/fade-out
with
fullscreen
videos
(which
I'd
already
fixed).
I
saw
the
preference
browser.fullscreen.animateUp
described
in
http://kb.mozillazine.org/Browser.fullscreen.animateUp
and
mentioned
in
https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1066680
.
This
seems
to
be
what
I'm
looking
for,
or
it
used
to
…
My
about:config
did
not
have
this
preference
by
default.
I
added
a
preference
with
the
proper
name
and
tried
setting
it
to
string
values
'0',
'1',
and
'2'
and
integer
values
0,
1,
and
2
with
no
effect
either
immediate
or
on
Firefox
restart.
That
is,
the
F11
animation
did
not
change.
After
refreshing
my
Firefox
through
Troubleshooting

I
tried
all
six
again
with
still
no

I
am

to
log
in
on
the
home
page
for
a
addon
to
make
a
comment.
I
wanted
to
maybe
help
someone.
I
had
used
all
the
same
password
at
one
time
but
changed
that
over
time.
Also
some
sites
want
a
user
name
and
some
want
a
email
address.
At
least
that's
how
it
was
when
I
last
changed
them.
After
I
try
all
the
combinations
and
permutations,
I
clicked
on
the
forgot
my
password
line.
I
got
a
warning
about
losing
data
because
of
syncing,
so
I
decided
to
simply
try
to
create
a
new
account
.
Of
course
it
came
back
and
told
me
that
both
my
email
address
and
user
name
were
already
in
use.
It
would
seem
that
some
where
along
the
line
if
there
is
some
magic
account
that
all
the
Firefox/Mozilla
logins
would
be
consolidated
into
one.
All
the
former
logins
are
because
Firefox
grew
like
topsy,
along
with
all
the
cosmetic
changes,
maybe
the
logins
got
sorted
out,
but
I
can't
tell.
What
happens
if
I
try
to
get
a
new
password?
Does
that
work
for
all
the
various
logins?
As
far
as
I
know
I
never
set
up
any
sync
account
on
Firefox,
is
that
the
account
we
are
talking
about
here,
or
is
it
another,
separate
login?
The
big
question
is
how
many
separate
logins
are
there
in
Firefox/Mozilla
and
what
are
they?

do?
Ever
since

there's
something
wrong
with
the

All
of

look
like
they've
doubled

basically
like
they

You

at

get

I've
kept

most
of

killed

everything
I
do

still
open

(I
have
two
of

still
running

I
kill
all
of
them

I
even
did
a

pull

just
to

Re:

startup

Unfortunately,
suddenly,
without
any
action
of
myself,
I
am
unable
to
open
Mozilla
Firefox
webbrowser,
which
I
normally
startup
with
the

not
including

appears
now.
I
cant
find
out
myself
where
this

called

or

to
be
followed,
replaced
itself
now,
so
I
am
unable
to
open.
I
checked
my

files
(x86)
where
Mozilla
is
located.
Not
even
Firefox.exe
can
be
found.
I
followed
some
of
your
solution
paths
and
I
thought
'the
refreshing
method'
one
is
the
most
quickest
and
easiest
way,
but
as
I
cant
enter
Firefox
(also
not
with
your
instruction)
I
cant
even
follow
this
solution.
I
have
no
option
than
to
contact
you
per
Internet

What
can
I
do?
I
will
not
remove

cause
I
have
done
that
in
the
past
and
Firefox
didnot
work
at
all
anymore.
For
your
information

working
in

till
yesterday
I
didnot
have
any
problem
and
Firefox
had
been
working
in
the
fastest
way
possible
ever
since
years.
Can
you
please
help
me
to
fix
this
problem,
I
dont
believe
it
is
a
big
problem,
but
moreover
what
most
surprises
me
is
how
a

can
change

its

that

that

I
do
not

this

earlier

downloading
it.

have
been
using

I
haven't
tried
anything
yet
so
am
open
to

to

it,
but
I'm
not

Lo
que

reinstalar
el

sin
solucionar
este
inconvenientes.

de
pasarme
de

allá

no
lo
he
cambiado
ya
que
la

lo
que
me
hizo
elegir
este

Hay
algo

para
poder

Please
note
that
newer

of

require
you
go
through
a
series
of
steps
to
activate
the
Flash
Player.
You
can
read
more
about
their
update
here:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox/Releases/55
We
now
recommend
that
Mac
users
use
Safari
and
that
PC
users
use
IE/Edge.
Alternatively,
we
at

love
Chrome
so
you
could
certainly
use
that

I

I
have
Firefox
55.0.3
running
on

OS
X
Yosemite
10.10.5.
I
have
tried
two
methods
to
delete
bookmarks:
*
Select
the
bookmark,
right-click,
select
'delete'.
I
get
the
message
'[JavaScript

Select
a
bookmark
from
the
bookmark
symbol
next
to
the

hit
the

select
'Remove

but
nothing
happens.
How
do
I
remove
a

This

very
frustrating.
Thank

much.

Why
has
Firefox
overridden
my
highlighting
with
the
tear
drop
highlights?
Before
I
could
'highlight'
by
just
touching
on
touchscreen
what
I
wanted
to
highlight
and
copy.
Now,
with
Firefox
I
must
use
the
little
'teardrops'
to
highlight.
How
can
I
disable
that?

I'm
not
sure
what
happened
but
my
bookmarks
are
all
gone
&
browsing
history.
I
think
Firefox
might
have
crashed.
I
tried
restarting

but
my

are
all
gone.
When
I
click
on
'Bookmarks'
on
the

there
are
only
a
couple
main
things
there
like,
'Show
all

'Bookmark

'Bookmark

but
all
my
bookmarks
are
gone,
nothing
else
there.
I
tried
'Import

but
it
doesn't
work,
it
doesn't
restore
the

when
I
click
on
any
of

I
tried
renaming
the

file(that's
Ive
done
before
that
worked
before)
but
that
isn't
even
working
now.
I
think
I
might
have
to
go
back
a
day
or
2
&
it
might
be
trying
to
restore
them
from

or
something
&
it
isn't
working.
I
still
cant
get
any
of

Could
you
please
help
me
to
get

I
would
really
appreciate

Firefox

all
started

How

The

Just
that
it

that
would
help.
Before
the

I

all
I
get

the

Firefox
is
not
displaying
my
website's
prices
correctly.
(works
on
other
browsers)
So
our
company
website
is
selininy.com
Our
prices
on
Firefox
do
not
always
show
up
correctly,
but
in
chrome
&
edge
they
display
just
fine.
Our
programmer
who
handled
this
code
unexpectedly
left
our
company
&
I'm
not
a
programmer
myself,
although
I
can
usually
stumble
my
way
into
a
solution
-
but
this
has
me
stumped.
I'm
pretty
sure
it
has
to
do
with
the
small
bit
of
java
that
we
use
to
divide
the
price
by
how
many
'pieces'
or
'pairs'
are
in
each
item
so
that
we
show
our
customers
the
'unit
price'.
(ex.
a
12pc
Bow
Tie
set
=
$12..so
the
unit
price
shows
in
'$1
per
unit'.)
The
weird
thing
is
if
you
refresh
the
page
a
few
times
it
may
display
the
correct
'unit
price',
and
vice-versa,
if
its
showing
the
incorrect
price
refreshing
the
page
sometimes
makes
the
price
read
correctly.
Also,
when
the
price
is
displaying
incorrectly,
the
item
name
has
the
words
'Original
text'
added
to
the
end
of
the
product
name.
This
issue
only
affects
item
prices
which
are
being
divided
to
show
the
'unit
price'.
which
makes
me
think
its
that
bit
of
java
that
i
mentioned
above.
An
example
item
that
has
this
issue
is:
https://selininy.com/ties/6-pc-prepack-diamond-tip-banded-bow-tie-dbb3030-27/
^^
the
above
product
should
be
displaying
a
price
of
'$2.50
per
unit',
6
unit
per
pack
for
a
total
price
of
$15.00.
------for
me
now
it
is
displaying:
'$0.23
per
unit',
66
units
per
pack
for
a
total
of
$15.00.
-
After
I
refresh
this
page
a
few
times
the
price
and
units
per
pack
show
the
correct
price
now.
I
will
attach
photos
of
each
scenario
for
better
understanding.
I
don't
even
know
if
this
is
the
correct
place
to
ask
for
help
so
any
and
all
information
would
be
greatly
appreciated!

Hello,
Firefox
56.0b6
crashes
during
startup
with
EAF
mitigation
(
EMET
5.2
on
Windows

x64
).
It
doesn't
happen
on
earlier
versions
(
56.0b5
for

)
of

so
I
wonder
is
something
has
changed?

Videos
appear
with
a
purple/green
layer
over
it?
I
just
downloaded
firefox
(love
it
much
more
than
chrome)
but
whenever
i
watch
videos
on
any
site
it
appears
with
a
purple-pinkish
version
of
the
video
with
a
green
distorted
version
layered
with
it
too
but
it
does
not
happen
in
any
of
the
other
browsers.
The
first
solution
i
found
online
was
to
change
the
'use
hardware
acceleration
when
available'.
i
just
checked
it
restart
and
unchecked
it
restart
nothing
happened,
but
if
i
have
to
change
the
number
then
help
me
that,
if
that
is
not
the
solution
at
all
THEN
HOW
DOES
ONE

so
now
I
have
about
twenty
tabs
that
still
have
the
logo
of
the
site
they
were
at,
but
instead
of
opening
to
that
location
when
I
click
on
one
of
those
tabs,
it
opens
to
nothing.
In
addition
to
the
logo
of
the
former
site,
the
tabs
all
say
'New
Tab.'
Now,
ideally,
I'd
like
to
get
those
'forgotten'
sites
back,
but
I'll
settle
for
being
able
to
close
all
those
tabs
so
I
can
make
a
fresh
start!
The
newest
update
will
not
install.
What
a
piece
of
trash
Every
time
I
open
Firefox,
it
tries
to
update,
but
goes
around
in
an
endless
circle,
refusing
to
do
so.
I
am
going
to
uninstall
it
unless
it
can
become
functional.
I
am
totally
disgusted
and
have
better
things
to
do
that
fool
with
a
system
that
no
longer
works.
Embedded
video
is
not
showing
up
Firefox
is
not
displaying
embedded
video
(maybe
a
plugin
issue?).
However,
when
I
visit
the
same
sites
on
Chrome,
I
can
watch
the
video.
The
embedded
video
is
from
YouTube.
Any
ideas
how
to
fix
this?
YouTube
audio
continues
to
play
after
hitting
back
button
This
has
been
going
on
for
roughly
a
month,
now.
I
will
start
to
watch
a
YouTube
video.
If
I
hit
the
back
button
during
the
video
the
page
will
go
back,
but
the
audio
from
the
video
continues
to
play
in
the
background
until
the
video
completes.
Doesn't
stop
unless
I
click
on
another
link
or
if
I
paused/stopped
the
video
before
going
back.
I
have
disabled
all
add-ons
and
it
continues.
Deleted
all
add-ons
and
it
continues.
Reinstalled
Firefox
and
it
continues.
Tried
it
in
Chrome
and
it
does
NOT
happen.

I
have
managed
to
make
my
messages
in
duplicate.
How
do
I
change
the
setting
to
eliminate
these
double
entries?
I
don't
know
how
I
did
this.
When
I
enter
a
message
on
FB
it
enters
a
duplicate.
Does
anyone
know
how
to
fix
this?
is
there
a
complete
list
of
config
entries?
today
i
created
a
new
profile
to
FF
to
start
over.
i
noticed
that
some
config
settings
i
set
a
few
years
ago
(and
kept
them
with
each
upgrade)
no
longer
work/exist.
FF
seems
to
somehow
kept
them
in
his
'memory'
and
they
working
fine.
i
tried
to
create
them
manually
but
FF
doesn't
recognize
them.
these
are
the
config
entries
in
question:
browser.tabs.animate
browser.fullscreen.animate
so
i
want
to
know
if
there
is
a
complete
list
by
Mozilla
of
all
config
entries
so
i
can
take
a
look.
Firefox
icon
missing
as
default
browser
in
Windows
Explorer
I
had
installed
Chrome
on
another
user
acct
on
my
computer.
I
use
different
Windows
user
accts
for
different
browsers.
I
broke
my
rule
and
opened
Chrome
in
my
Firefox
user
acct,
first
time.
Chrome
made
itself
default.
FF
options
didn't
work
to
change
FF
back
to
default
so
I
used
Windows
control
panel
to
set
FF
as
default
program
for
'all
22
things
that
it
can
open'.
This
worked,
FF
is
again
my
default
browser,
but
in
Windows
Explorer,
icons
for
my
stored
html
and
htm
files
gradually
disappeared,
I
could
not
spot
the
exact
pattern
as
to
how
this
happened,
but
now
all
my
html
documents
listed
in
explorer
show
a
blank
white
icon.
Other
than
that
everything
seems
to
work
as
normal
but
I
don't
like
something
being
a
little
off,
it
makes
me
worry
that
there
is
something
lurking,
a
bigger
problem
under
the
surface.
EDIT:
My
FF
is
the
latest
version,
I
updated
it
today
and
nothing
changed.
My
Chrome
is
v.60.0.3112.113.
I

About
a
week
ago,
I
accidentally
clicked
on
'change
to
new
JUNO'
(or
some
such),
but
preferred
the
Classic
Juno,
so
tried
to
change
back
to
that.
That
messed
me
up
terribly
---
contacted
JUNO;
tried
what
they
suggested;
that
wiped
out
my
security
program;
immediately
took
computer
to
Geek
Squad
who
reinstalled
security
&
checked
computer
thoroughly
(all
was
well);
but
Geek
Squad
didn't
know
how
to
correct
the
problem
started
by
the
change:
the
'formatting
instructions'
show
up
and
stay
when
I
REPLY
and/or
FORWARD
email
messages
and
when
I
put
a
clean
message
into
DRAFT
folder
to
come
back
to
later
----
when
taken
out
of
DRAFT
to
work
on,
the
msg.
has
all
the
annoying
'instructions.'
Also,
my
typing
in
neat
paragraphs
will
appear
as
one
big
wad
of
words
at
the
recipients'
computer.
JUNO's
latest
suggestion
to
me
says:
...
and
I
quote:
'
I

JUNO
has
recommended
I
switch
to
CHROME.
I
don't
want
to
do
that.
Though
I
can't
go
back
and
get
a
sample
of
the
problem
without
losing
all
this,
I
can
give
you
a
sample
of
what
is
happening:
>html><p>
Hey,</p><p>Carole,
a
classmate,
passed
away
on
Friday.</p><p><br>Funeral
services
will
be
Wednesday.</p><p><p>...<br><br>.....
There
are
other
'instructions'
and
other
messages,
but
I
can't
get
to
them
to
show
you.
Oh,
please,
please,
can
you
help
me
and
get
this
mess
out
of
my
computer?
Many
thanks!!
Unable
to
upgrade
past
54.0.1
I
am
running
version
54.0.1
(32-bit)
on
Windows
10.
I
often
have
problems
opening
Firefox
because
old
Firefox
processes
are
still
running
in
Windows
(despite
the
application
having
been
closed
properly
from
a
UI
perspective).
I
have
tried
to
upgrade
many
times.
I
can't
upgrade
automatically
because
the
restart
of
Firefox
fails
after
the
update
downloads.
If
I
use
the
installer
that
I
downloaded,
I
can
get
to
a
new
version
for
one
session
--
today
it
was
55.0.3
(64-bit)
--
but
after
i
close
Firefox
and
re-open
it
again,
I
somehow
magically
revert
to
the
older
version
(54.0.1).
How
can
I
update
to
the
latest
version
of
Firefox
for
good
and
hopefully
get
past
the
issue
with
processes
not
closing
properly
in
Windows?
Thank
you
for
your
help.

The

completely
screwed
me
over,
I
am
constantly
getting
adobe
and
shockwave
crashes
now
because
of
this,
how
do
I

I
uninstalled
and
reinstalled
Adobe.
This
has
only
started
happening
since
that
update.
I
watched
Firefox
update
at
the
time
and
I
have
had
issues
ever
since.
Most
websites
I
go
to
now
that
have
videos
are
now
unwatchable
because
it
constantly
crashes
24/7.
What
do
I
do
to
fix
this?
Do
I
just
stop
using
firefox
completely?
Because
that's
what
I
am
considering
doing.
How
dumb
is
it
for
1
update
to
completely
screw
me
over?
I
have
disabled
all
Addons
as
well
and
it's
still
the
same
problem.

Firefox
crashes
within
the
last
couple
of
days
when
I
try
to
watch
a
video
on
the
internet
with
Firefox
the
video
almost
always
crashes
at
least
once,
it
has
rarely
crashed
otherwise.
Ive
run
scans
on
my
computer,
tried
Firefox
in
safe
mode,
tried
restarting
my
computer,
and
made
sure
that
Firefox
is
up
to
date.
Firefox
57
will
break
safety
and
accessibility
tools?
Why?
Apparently
Firefox
57
will
break
most
extensions.
These
include
a
number
of
safety
and
accessibility
tools,
so
either
users
will
need
replacement
tools,
or
we'll
need
to
stick
with
56.
I'm
photosensitive.
I
get
nasty
migraines,
and
other
symptoms,
but
luckily
not
seizures.
I
need
25
animation-blocking
tools,
including
10
'legacy'
animation-blocking
extensions,
and
12
animation-blocking
user-styles.
It
won't
be
easy
to
track
down
replacement
tools.
addons.mozilla.org
is
itself
full
of
animation,
with
the
top
bar
growing
as
it
loads,
and
with
items
flashing
on
mouseover.
Why
does
Firefox
shut
off
seconds
after
my
home
page
appears?
This
happens
only
since
today's
upgrade
of
Firefox.
I
initially
had
trouble
getting
it
to
go
to
my
homepage,
(MSN.com),
instead
of
the
Firefox
search
page.
Once
I
did
it
began
to
shut
off
immediately
after
initializing,
unless
I
could
open
the
menu
button
fast
enough.
where
is
the
extension
for
Express
VPN?
Hi
-
I've
done
it
on
one
computer
with
no
problems,
but
not
on
this
one.
Through
Express
it
says
'Get
Chrome
extension'
and
'Get
Firefox'
(instead
of
get
extension)
-
I've
got
Firefox
and
I'm
logged
into
it.
I've
tried
searching
FF
for
the
extension
but
there
isn't
one
listed.
What
am
I
missing?
Thanks

i

can
someone
tell

why
when
i
type

in
the

i
have
a

where
it

(search
for

a

how
to
disable
them?
I
don't
believe
i
had
those.
cursor

from
Google

I
go
to
google.com,
click
in

box,
and
start

At
some
point,
the
cursor
moves
out
of

box
and
I
have
to
click
in
the
search
box
again
to
continue.
There's
no
pattern
that
I
can
see.
It's
not
always
after
the
same
number
of
characters,
nor
is
it
always
after
the
same
amount
of
time.
Any
ideas?
TIA
Autofill
for
logins
works
incorrectly.
Can't
delete
logins.
Can't
turn
off
'remember
logins
for
sites'.
Can't
block
sites.
Exemptions
don't
work.
I
noticed
that
my
Yahoo
mail
login
box
auto-fills
logins
I
don't
use
-
or
logins
I
don't
want
anyone
to
see.
After
recent
Firefox
update
to
55.0.3
64
bit
-
I
can't
delete
those
entries.
What
I
could
easily
do
before
-
drop
down
the
list
and
hit
delete
-
doesn't
work
anymore.
But
what
bothers
me
most
-
is
that
there
are
entries
there
-
that
appeared
-
that
I
didn't
use
in
years!!!
It
was
not
me
doing
that!
I
didn't
put
that
information
there.
It
looks
like
somehow
Yahoo
or
Firefox
retrieved
that
information
and
posted
it
in
a
list.
Why?
The
'remember
logins
for
sites'
checkbox
does
nothing.
Exceptions
don't
work.
I
typed
yahoo.com
there
and
clicked
on
exemptions
and
it
did
nothing.
I
erased
yahoo.com
from
the
list
below
that
box
-
and
it
did
nothing.
I
uninstalled
Firefox
-
then
reinstalled
a
fresh
copy
-
still
the
same.
All
bookmarks
came
back
and
the
auto-fill
logins
are
still
there!
I
tried
to
remove
or
turn
off
autocomplete
from
about:config
-
but
there
is
no
such
setting
in
it.
Did
someone
hack
my
PC?
Is
this
yahoo
doing
that?
Can
this
be
somehow
blocked?
In
any
case
-
please
help
me
-
or
I
will
be
forced
to
permanently
erase
Firefox,
because
I
really
can't
have
anyone
see
the
information.
It
is
horrible
that
I
can't
delete
that.
I
feel
that
I
have
no
control
over
what
I
can
and
what
I
cannot
delete
on
my
own
computer!
But
what
is
even
more
horrible
-
is
that
I
cannot
install
fresh
and
clean
Firefox.
It
remembers
everything
-
and
I
wanted
it
to
delete
everything!!!
How
to
delete
those
damn
logins?!
How
do
I
display
open
tabs
on
top
in
stead
of
sidebar?
I
had
once
opted
to
have
tabs
on
sidebar.
I
want
to
go
back
to
the
old
system
of
tabs
displayed
on
top
and
not
in
sidebar.
After
latest
update,
Firefos
does
not
start
with
last
windows
&
tabs
despite
setting
in
options.
How
to
rectify
this?
On
26
August
2017
Firefox
was
last
updated.
I
have
always
opted
for
'Show
windows
&
tabs
from
last
time'
when
Firefox
restarts.
It
has
been
working
fine
all
these
years.
But
now
when
Firefox
is
started,
the
tabs
pages
are
blank.
Web
page
address
is
also
gone
from
the
address
bar.
My
last
opened
page
is
lost.

I
am
unable
to
authenticate
to

it

asking
password
even
I
have
supplied
the
correct
password.
I
tested
the
condition
using
other
browser
and
it
works
with
Chromium.
How
should
I
connect
to
the
proxy
?

blank.
if

of

i
can

i
then
can't
see
what
i'm

doing.
When
i

the

bar
should
be
or
where
the

it
will

I
can
fix
this
for

its
a

for
a

I
have
many
problems
with
Firefox
when
playing
Miniclip
8
ball
pool...
The
issues
are
(1)
if
the
yellow
triangle
over
a
gray
padlock
is
showing,
the
game
will
not
play
correctly......I
have
tried
using
the
'about'config'
setting
and
changing
the
one
setting
as
mentioned
on
Firefox
elsewhere,
and
while
that
usually
results
in
a
green
padlock,
it
does
not
always
'fix'
the
game
issue.
(2)
While
the
game
is
loading,
I
see
at
least
50
or
more
'websites
'
(??)
that
are
showing
in
the
lower
left
corner
of
the
screen.........I
don't
know
why
all
of
these
show
and
if
there's
anything
that
can
be
done
to
eliminate
them;
they
cause
a
slow
loading
of
the
game........(3)
The
loading
circle
will
often
spin
as
if
the
game
is
trying
to
reload,
but
it
does
not
reload...this
happens
many
times
while
in
game
play.
There
are
other
problems
as
well,
but
if
I
can
find
solutions
to
these
