Which
cooky
to
allow
for
firefox
sync
to
work
Hello
I
have
strict
cookie
control
on
Firefox
because
there
are
only
a
few
site
I
really
need
to
allow
cooky
from
in
order
to
have
a
proper
browse
experience
So
I
have
the
Accept
cooky
from
site
option
uncheck
and
whenever
I
decide
to
allow
cooky
from
a
site
I
add
an
exception
for
it
I
would
like
to
allow
all
Firefoxrelated
cooky
so
that
all
Firefox
function
work
correctly
include
Sync
These
are
the
Allow
exception
I
currently
have
list
for
Firefoxrelated
cooky
aboutaccount
aboutconfig
aboutpreference
httpmozillaorg
httpsmozillaorg
With
these
exception
Firefox
is
give
an
error
message
when
try
to
sign
into
sync
Cookies
and
local
storage
are
require
Which
cookie
exception
do
I
need
to
add
for
Sync
to
function
Also
are
any
of
the
exception
I
currently
have
unnecessary
For
example
Do
I
need
to
have
entry
for
both
httpmozillaorg
and
httpsmozillaorg
or
only
one
of
them
I
believe
my
Firefox
version
is
530
latest
version
install
on
22
Apr
2017
when
save
a
page
no
file
dialog
is
display
When
i
try
to
save
a
page
no
file
dialog
ask
for
a
filename
is
display
When
i
want
to
download
a
file
the
file
dialog
is
not
display
either
Normaly
i
have
set
the
save
option
to
ask
alway
The
only
way
to
download
is
to

Happend

aurora
I
have
remove
Firefox
completely
and
reinstall
an
older
version

that
had
the
same
problem
after
the
installation
Running
on
Windows

could
that
be
an
issue
with
a
Windows
update
because
the
older
Firefox
version
has
the
same

I
am

Never

on
random
occasion
freez

I
have
to
use

there
I
see
list
FIREFOX

to

TASK
so
as
to
be
able
to
get
out
of
the
frozen

I
thus
will
loose
certain
thing
when

return
ie
usually

I
have
to
go

check
that
box

I
have
almost
no

other
than

So
I

I
have

Im

This

youre
currently
view
within
Firefox
into
a
folder
open
with
a

in

create

Usually
it
wouldnt
take
half
a
second
to
create
the
shortcut
but
in
my
case
it
take
like
more
than
5
second
on
average
to
complete
task
and
the
CPU
usage
get
very
high
all
the

I
use

at

Oddly
this

do
never

UPDATE
Hello
Just
a
small
update
Im
really
sorry
but
I
havent
follow
your
suggestion
of
go
in
to
Safe
Mode
yet
Its
been
a
couple
month
but
Im
usually
very
busy
when
Im
use
this
computer
and
Im
still
use
a
HDD
instead
of
a
SSD
so
reboote
in
Safe
Mode
and
go
back
to
Normal
Boot
Mode
take
forever
so
Im
alway
reluctant
to
try
it
And
Im
afraid
to
say
that
I
dont
think
Ill
have
the
time
to
do
so
any
time
soon
as
Im
alway
busy
with
work
I
however
have
try
temporarily
turn
off
my
Antivirus
software
namely
Avast
Free
Antivirus
and
test
mak
a
url
file
in
the
same
way
as
before
but
it
still
take
very
long
to
complete
the
task
Im
definitely
sure
it
take
as
long
as
when
my
Antivirus
is
turn
on
Also
Im
no
expert
in
the
matter
but
I
strongly
suspect
the
problem
doesnt
have
to
do
with
my
Antivirus
because
my
problem
happen
ONLY
with
Firefox
and
no
other
browser
such
as
Vivaldi
and
so
on
And
my
Antivirus
DOES
interfere
with
these
other
browser
and
also
all
kind
of
other
program
for
that
matter
such
as
my
download
manager
etc
it
alway
block
the
same
suspicious
webpage
regardless
of
which
browser
or
download
manager
I
use
to
access
them
So
dear
Firefox
expert
would
you
please
kindly
point
me
in
the
right
direction
in
case
my
report
above
has
trigger
some
insight
into
solve
this
problem
I
personally
find
this
problem
extremely
annoy
as
I
alway
have
to
use
FIrefox
in
Private
Browsing
Mode
to
circumvent
this
problem
and
make
Firefox
functional
and
in
this
case
I
lose
track
of
all
my
brow
history
So
please
say
anything
on
the
matter
Thanks
in
advance

even
ridiculous

doesnt
work
Ive
try
to
restore

default
in

and
change
those
around
several
time
se
if
it
was
just
the
specific
engine
I
was
select
but
to
no
avail
I
had
consider
the
possibility
that
it
because
Im
use
a
heavily
modify

which
has
a
custom

but
that
homepage
graphic
modification
work
for
several
month
before

there
no
reason
why
it
wouldnt
continue

now
all
of
a
sudden
Its
not
a
big
huge
fat
stink
deal
to
me

would
be
nice
to
know
if
other
have
had
this
issue
and
know
a
simple
quick
nonresettingeverything
fix
for
it
Ive
got
a
lot
of
time
and
effort
invest
into

improve
the

and
reinstal
everything
and
then
reconfigure
every
set
of
all
the
addon
But
if
there
something
else
I
dont
know
about
that
make
this
a
common
problem
with
a
reasonable
solution
Im
all
ear
I
will
not
apply
the
newest
update
to
Firefox
so
dont
suggest
it
There
are
two
reason
why
In
general
I
believe
in
database
proof
and
new
thing
dont
have
enough
data
yet
to
prove
their
mettle
No
matter
what
any
developer
say
about
the
theoretical
benefit
a
better
developer
will
come
along
and
say
let
the
test
prove
the
theory
and
that
what
I
do
Secondly
Ive
seen
that
some
of
the
addon
and
extension
I
currently
use
and
am
fond
of
will
no
longer
work
if
I
do
So
that
a
NO
Currently
I
am
use
Firefox
5101
with
Google
set
to
my
default
search
engine
If
more
detail
are
need
I
will
respond
to
the
question
accordingly
Thank
you
for
your
time

Load
only
specific
image
of
a
web
page
to
reduce
traffic
on
mobile
internet
connection
Searching
the
web
for
about
to
two
hour
I
wasnt
able
to
find
a
suitible
solution
so
you
are
my
hope
Here
is
Topic
in
detail
Im
use
a
mobile
internet
connection
which
has
a
limite
data
volume
So
Im
try
to
reduce
my
traffic
while
browse
Some
page
have
a
huge
number
of
or
big
image
which
cost
me
a
lot
So
Im
look
for
a
solution
to
only
load
those
image
Id
like
to
have
a
look
on
I
thougt
there
might
be
an
addon
to
achieve
this
but
I
could
only
finde
opportunity
to
disable
image
in
general
Ive
try
the
addon
ImageLikeOpera
but
seem
to
have
no
effekt
and
I
couldent
change
any
set
because
the
set
window
doesnt
close
when
I
hit
the
OK
button
I
imagine
to
maybe
get
box
display
instead
of
image
with
the
text
of
the
alt
key
of
html
and
a
possiblility
to
load
the
image
by
either
mouse
over
or
a
klick
on
a
button
Any
help
or
hint
are
highly
appreciate

jnlp

With
Firefox
ESR

i
had
no
problem
launch
our
KVM
jnlp
applet
which
is
part
of
Asus
Motherboard
IPMI
for
remote

management
With

I
am
unable
to
launch
the

from
the
newer

ASMB8iKVM
however
the
applet
still
launch
fine
from
the
older
motherboard
use
ASMB6iKVM
IPMI
I
read
this
might
be
because
of
NPAPI
support
yet
the
suggestion
is
to
use
the
ESR
release
which
im
use
which
is
good
until
2018
In
case
you’re
not
yet
ready
for
this
transition
to
happen
the

Extended
Support
Release
of
Firefox
52
will
continue
to
support
these
plugin
until
early
2018
So
maybe
it
something
else

Any
workaround
to
make
FF53
on

work
on

without
SSE2
Firefox5202
5202+linuxmint1
work
fine
on
all
of
my
Linux
Mint
release

I
have
this
many
because
do
comparative
test
to
see
which
one
run
best
on
my
old
system
Latest
update
to
FF53
530+linuxmint1
crash
without
ever
open
just
get
error
message
say
FF
crash
I
try
starte
use
SafeMode
with
no
success
either
safemode
screen
came
up
but
disappear
in
about
2
second
with
no
response
when
punch
enter
safemode
button
Previously
with
FF5202
same
crash
but
I
solve
it
by
remove
adobe
flashplugin
installer
After
FF53
update
via
LinuxMint
Update
Manager
nothing
have
to
do
with
adobe
flashplugin
has
not
been
ad
I
notice
that
on
this
Mozilla
webpage
httpswwwmozillaorgenUSfirefox530systemrequirements
that
under
Recommended
Hardware
this
show
Pentium
4
or
newer
processor
that
support
SSE2
My
old
AMD
Athlon
XP2000+
1667
GHz
do
not
support
SSE2
it
only
support
SSE
Im
wonder
if
the
reason
FF53
doesnt
work
is
because
it
no
longer
support
SSE
as
every
version
up
through
FF5202
did
If
so
is
there
a
workaround
I
can
apply
that
will
enable
FF53
and
later
version
update
to
work
on
my
system

Hello
SirMadam
I
know
that
Mozilla
Firefox
doesnt
support
Java
but
several
webpage
are
base
on
it
And
if
one
should
need
to
print
out
something
from
the
web
Firefox
doesnt
print
it
as
it
doesnt
support
Java
This
is
extremely
frustrate
And
then
one
has
to
revert
to
Chrome
A
good
example
is
when
you
book
airplane
ticket
not
sure
if
they
use
Java
but
all
of
the
European
airline
web
page
when
try
to
print
the
ticket
confirmation
you
only
receive
a
blank
page
If
this
is
because
Java
has
Mozilla
thought
about
a
workaround
or
will
it
just
not
support
Java
Best
regard

not

exactly
when
it

there
any

find
me
a

do
I
prevent
this
I
usually
save

from

by
drag
it
from

In

recent
update
when
I
try
to
do
this
Firefox
also
open
the

is
unnecessary
as
I
already
save
the

through
drag

drop
and
now
need
to
close
this
unnecessary
window
How
do
I
turn

to
it
a

file
So
my
queston
will
be
is

them
like
a
safe
point
or
something
like
that
And
how
I

Ill

an

how
to
prevent

from
load
too
much
of

to
eat
my
memory
My
usable
memory
is
only
2G
Whenever
gmail
was
open
by
firefox
at
least
400M
memory
is
gone
When
I
open
my
both
gmail
account
the
total

usage
is

I
usually
have
to
kill
firefox
and
give
it
a
fresh
restart
to
release
the
memory
it
take
which
is
very
very
annoy
and
timeconsume
I
presume
firefox
try
to
load
as
much
information
as
it
can
find
in
gmail
in
an
effort
to
speed
up
turnaround
which
is
fine
for
a
computer
with
say
4G
memory
but
to
me
it
is
a
disaster
as
explain
above
Since
most
of
the
information
load
is
not
need
in
a
single
session
I
wonder
whether
firefox
can
change
it
default
load
style
for
gmail
to
balance
between
speed
and
size
or
at
least
give
user
an
option
to
control
it
say
not
load
the
hidden
label
or
unopen
tab
only
the
first

etc

What
is
the

location
for

Nightly
64bit
On
Fedora
25
64bit
Linux
my
local
install
of
Firefox
Nightly
64bit
wasnt
find
the
Flash
plugin
which
I
install
with
`sudo

But
the

Firefox
find
it
fine
by
read
the
directory
usrlib64mozillaplugins
which
has
a

to
usrlib64flashpluginlibflashplayerso
I
confirm
use
`strace`
that
Firefox
Nightly
do
not
search
this
directory
but
Fedoras
system
Firefox
do
search
it
maybe
because
HAVE_USR_LIB64_DIR
is
not
define

The

Solution
for
the

thread
Where
do
I
put

httpssupportmozillaorgenUSquestions1030381fpa=1
say
to
put
it
in
usrlib64firefoxbrowserplugins
but
Nightly
doesnt

either
I
solve
this
by
create

is
an
issue
with

itself
not

may
be
a

small

what
good
is
Do

Location
privacy
set
if
clearly
they
are
not
work
correctly
I
would
love
an
explanation
to
why
your

is
clearly
disobey
what
I
tell
it
to

Previously
a
few
weak
I
install
Frirefox
x64
instead
of
FF
x32
I
notice
that
the
FF
icon
move
on
the
window
taskbar
barre
de
tach
in
fact
it
was
a
new
icon
and
when
click

a

with
the

Hi
In

it
was
possible
to

click
on
the

placeholder
select

and
it
load
Now
it
work

you

this
is
crap
because
I
have
a
slow

and
cant
afford
to
enable
j
problem
with
auto
fill
Hi
The
fact
that
the
password
is
autofill
is
a
browser
set
and
not
controller
by
Netchb
if
you
click
on
Change
Entry
Status
the
only
way
the
entry
will
get
delete
if
you
are
on
that
page
is
if
you
click
Delete
Entry
and
enter
your
password
if
it
not
autofill
or
if
you
press
enter
while
the
cursor
is
in
the
password
field
If
you
do
not
want
your
password
to
be
autofill
see

Why
did
Firefox
upgrade
my
browser
even
if
I
had
upgrade
disable
Yesterday
I
downgrad
my
browser
from
530
to
4402
due
to
incompatibility
with
extension
I
delete
the
app
file
along
with
3
directory
within
my
user
profile
then
a
fresh
install
of
4402
I
immediately
went
into
Preferences
and
disable
the
upgrade
check
option
completely
This
morn
I
log
in
to
my
Mac
and
receive
a
message
about
the
upgrade
back
to
53
Not
sure
why
this
would
happen
if
the
upgrade
option
is
disable
Would
Firefox
Sync
reenable
the
option
somehow
I
went
back
to
Preferences
and
check
the
Upgrade
option
and
it
is
clearly
disable
Compressed
tar
File
Extension
Truncated
when
Saving
File
on
Mac
When
I
download
and
save
file
the
extension
isnt
shown
but
Firefox
know
what
the
file
type
is
and
the
extension
is
save
This
is
fine
except
when
it
come
to
compress
tar
file
So
for
example
if
the
file
is
myfiletargz
I
get
ask
if
I
want
to
save
the
file
as
tar
or
gz
If
I
pick
tar
then
it
change
to
myfiletar
If
I
pick
gz
then
it
save
as
myfilegz
Neither
is
correct
Why
is
it
do
this
Searches
reveal
that
there
have
been
some
issue
with
extension
in
the
past
but
nothing
recent
And
the
problem
only

How
can
I
get
FF
to
dispaly
pwd
automatically
when
I
click
Saved
Logins
from
the
Security
Settings
screen
I
quite
frequently
have
to
lookup
a
password
for
a
site
because
I
have
to
reverify
that
I
am
who
I
say
I
am
FF
cant
and
doesnt
fill
this
in
because
the
page
is
not
the
correct
URL
to
trigger
it
and
I
generally
dont
have
to
or
even
can
enter
a
userid
So
I
have
to
go
through
the
rigamarole
that
is
require
to
popup
the
table
of
url
userid
password
I
it
possible
to
set
some
variable
or
option
that
will
get
FF
to
display
that
table
with
the
password
already
show
Yes
I
know
what
I
am
do
this
is
my
private
personal
computer
in
my
home
Nobody
else
use
it
And
if
there
is
somebody
else
look
up
my
password
I
probably
have
bigger
problem
than
some
stranger
log
into
my
gmail
account
TIA
for
any
help

Hello
everyone
Some
preliminary
information
I
use
Firefox
v5303
32bit
on
a
Windows
10
64bit
ASUS
laptop
Basically
every
day
I
keep
Mozilla
open
for
everything
relate
to
work
and
everything
else
personal
I
keep
open
at
the
same
time
in
Google
Chrome
My
security
set
in
Firefox
tell
it
to
Remember
History
with
no
exception
for
cooky
from
any
website
and
to
never
clear
anything
unless
I
tell
it
to
include
cooky
Within
Firefox
I
am
log
into
anywhere
from
610
different
programsservice
online
at
any
given
time
and
never
run
into
any
issue
except
as
it
relate
to
a
single
domain
salesforcecom
I
use
a
normal
salesforcecom
login
for
our
own
internal
instance
of
salesforce
but
then
another
company
I
work
with
has
their
own
Salesforce
instance
with
a
web
portal
use
their
own
domain
For
a
long
while
everything
work
fine
but
then
I
start
get
kick
out
from
the
second
salesforce
the
portal
instance
on
the
other
company
domain
URL
it
would
happen
sporadically
but
over
the
last
couple
of
year
it
gotten
to
the
point
where
it
happen
many
time
every
day
with
many
instance
happen
mere
minute
apart
Ive
gotten
1015
minute
into
a
detail
writeout
within
some
record
in
the
portal
and
when
I
attempt
to
post
the
message
it
ask
me
to
log
in
again
or
even
better
open
a
handful
of
tab
for
different
record
I
need
and
when
I
get
done
and
go
to
the
first
it
prompt
me
to
log
in
again
I
check
into
the
cooky
and
have
8
different
instance
of
the
domain
for
the
portal
all
with
different
cookie
name
of
course
I
notice
that
only
one
cookie
has
an
expiration
date
at
all
53019
exactly
2
year
from
today
so
I
can
assume
that
that
cookie
isnt
involve
with
this
since
it
likely
it
was
create
today
The
rest
of
the
cooky
have
the
Expiration
of
End
of
Session
which
to
my
knowledge
meant
the
next
time
I
close
the
browser
Thats
fine
if
this
is
the
case
still
leave
the
open
question
of
why
these
particular
login
are
expire
almost
randomly
Ive
ask
around
with
other
I
work
with
who
are
in
the
same
position
and
they
experience
no
issue
at
all
I
also
work
with
the
support
team
of
the
company
that
has
the
Salesforce
portal
instance
and
after
a
number
of
instance
of
review
everything
they
still
cant
figure
out
why
it
would
happen
to
only
me
across

machine
different

and

Ive
also
consider
the
use

to

Yesterday

Have
experience
zero
situation
in
which
this

do
not

never

Why
do

click
on

like
for
my

unend
multiple

I
have

FireFox
I
have
create

At

it
say
my

I
change
it
and
it
say

is
successful
Try
login
again
with
same
result
I
think
the
question
cover
my
problem
I
appear
to
be
in
an
endless
loop
The
puzzle
thing
is
that
when
I
ask
for
the
reset
link
and
use
that
it
say
my
password
reset
is
successful
but
when
I
try

it

delay

So
Im
do

call

Hangouts
on

When
I
make
a
call
it
take
a
LONG
time
for
the
ring
to
start
on
my
end
In
fact
by
the
time
Ive
connect
the
person
on
the
other
end
has
sometime
already
pick
up
That
can
be
embarrass
With
GoogleTalk
there
was
never
any
delay
at
all
Weird
Im
use
Firefox
ESR
5212
which
I
back
off
to
originally
because
of
the
lack
of
support
for
GoogleTalk
Interestingly
the
situation
is
quite
different
on
Chrome
With
Chrome
it
take
a
solid
five
second
to
be
connect
to
the
line
In
Firefox
it
take
anywhere
from
seven
to
fifteen
second
Something
wrong
in
Firefox
I
think
I
wont
be
mak
Hangout
call
use
Firefox
anymore
Unless
someone
can
point
out
a
way
to
fix
this
How
can
I
set
the
print
footer
to
show
the
date
in
ISO8601
ccyymmdd
format
That
option
disappear
in
late
May
2017
I
see
that
someone
post
a
similar
concern
but
I
found
no
solution
post
there
So
to
support
that
person
that
theyre
not
the
only
one
with
such
a
request
Ill
add
my
two
cent
The
ccyymmdd
date
format
as
note
in
ISO8601
standard
is
the
prefer
date
format
be
in
a
logically
order
arrangement
from
the
larger
unit
onto
the
smallest
yearmonthday
That
sense
is
already
use
in
time
format
with
hhmmss
hourminutesecond
I
dont
know
how
the
common
American
date
format
became
so
establish
because
that
mix
of
unit
seem
arbitrary
In
addition
much
of
the
rest
of
the
world
use
the
ccyymmdd
or
even
ddmmccyy
or
ddMonccyy
for
their
date
format
Nonetheless
the
largertosmaller
unitsize
order
seem
most
logical
and
the
least
confuse
especially
when
the
full
year
ccyy
is
use
So
if
Mozilla
isnt
actually
promote
ISO8601
standard
it
would
be
great
if
at
least
that
option
was
provide
within
the
software
Firefox
has
been
my
choice
of
browser
for
year
So
thank
for
all
the
wonderful
improvement
over
the
year
and
thank
again
now
for
your
consideration

so
slow
on

I
really
enjoy
use

but
why
is
it
so
sluggish
and
slow
on

screen
Using
it
on
my
surface
with
the
touchpad
or
a
mouse
work
great
but
if
I
use
the
touch
screen
to
scroll
it
feel
like
a

the

run

are
borderline
useless
in

Why
is

not
load

I
go

just

then
there
is

not
work
I
am
use

5303
32bit
For
the
last
week
or
so
maybe
from
the
time
Firefox
update
the
toolbar
that
allow
me
to
modify
my
reply
to
comment
in
Wordpress
has
not
been
show
up
This
is
very
frustrate
as
without
the
toolbar
it
is
difficult
to
add
link
italics
bold
and
other
thing
to
my
reply
However
when
I
open
up
Wordpress
comment
in
Chrome
the
toolbar
is
there
See
screenshot
The
obvious
solution
is
to
just
use
Chrome
but
I
strongly
prefer
Firefox
for
all
my
browser
need
and
I
just
want
Wordpress
to
work
with

Thank
you
for

Since
Firefox
version
5300
yelp
and
other
site
that
load
facebook
content
slow
to
a
crawl
I
use
noscript
and
allow
everything
from
facebookcom
and
facebooknet
Ive
notice
that
access
yelp
since
version
5300
create
some
processor
hog
bottleneck
which
can
take
upward
of
two
minute
to
clear
two
minute
when
all
of
firefox
is
inaccessible
This
is
particularly
noticeable
on
page
for
individual
business
on
yelp
rather
than
expect
what
Im
describ
as
happen
when
you
land
on
the
front
page
of
yelp
To
be
sure
Ive
seen
this
behavior
across
several
domain
since
version
5300
but
yelp
stand
out
most
After
forbid
both
facebookcom
and
facebooknet
in
noscript
this
behavior
has
gone
away
To
confirm
my
find
I
enable
the
two
domain
again
in
noscript
and
the
behavior
reappear
I
can
live
with
two
random
domain
be
deny
permission
by
noscript
but
facebook
service
be
inaccessible
is
a
less
than
ideal
experience
on
the
web
as
we
know
it
Im
look
to
alert
the
developer
about
this
in
the
hope
that
a
fix
can
soon
be
issue

apply
However
Chromium
5803029110
Built
on
Ubuntu
run
on
LinuxMint
172
64Bit
work
just
fine
So
the
problem
is
obviously
in
FireFox
The
behavior
of
the
download
arrow
has
change
to
point
to
an
alia
of
a
download
file
and
not
the
file
itself
unless
you
use
the
magnify
glass
Ive
seen
several
people
reference
this
problem
on
the
forum
but
the
mod
dont
seem
to
indicate
they
understand
the
problem
when
they
answer
with
solution
like
clear
cache
change
file
type
response
etc
so
I
thought
Id
try
again
Until
a
couple
of
week
ago
a
macintosh
user
could
download
a
file
from
their
email
go
to
the
download
button
click
on
the
file
and
then
dragdrop
the
download
it
to
another
location
They
did
not
need
to
use
the
magnify
glass
to
navigate
to
the
download
folder
They
did
not
need
to
launch
the
file
and
save
it
They
did
not
need
to
keep
their
download
file
open
They
could
simply
drag
it
from
the
window
that
came
up
in
the
arrow
tool
If
you
do
that
same
behavior
now
you
get
a
file
location
statement
as
the
filenametype
as
oppose
to
the
file
itself
So
it
seem
to
me
that
the
behavior
of
the
download
arrow
has
been
change
to
point
to
an
alia
of
the
download
file
location
and
not
directly
to
the
file
itself
I
have
an
unhappy
editor
in
chief
who
now
has
to
navigate
to
the
file
she
want
to
copy
which
is
2
additional
step
than
what
she
use
to
have
to
do
So
it
doesnt
sound
like
a
big
deal
except
she
handle
several
hundre
image
a
week
via
email
and
this
change
just
triple
the
amount
of
keystroke
she
make
How
soon
can
we
revert
this
behavior
back
andor
can
you
give
any
tip
to
modify
the
behavior
of
the
download
arrow
Why
cant
I
drag
image
from
every
site
to
desktop
On
Firefox
I
can
drag
image
from
some
site
on
Tumblr
but
not
from
all
I
can
drag
an
image
from
Tumblr
or
Pinterest
on
Safari
that
I
cant
drag
from

On
Firefox
the
title
attribute
of
image
is
display
on
hover
But
if
you
stay
on
the
image
and
keep
hover
the
title
is
not
display
as
tootip
The
title
attribute
of
image
is
display
only
once
on
hover
If
you
want
to
see
the
title
attribute
again
you
have
to
hover
back
again
if
you
stay
on
the
image
and
keep
hover
you
will
not
see
the
title
attribute
where
as
in
Chrome
that
not
the
case
When
I
specify
a
container
folder
for
download
why
do
firefox
add
a
subfolder
with
the
same
name
Using
the
browse
functionality
I
select
the
file
folder
that
I
want
to
use
for
download
Firefox
insist
on
ad
another
subfolder
with
the
same
name
as
the
folder
I
just
select
How
can
I
select
the
file
folder
that
Firefox
use
for
download
Firefox
crash
Firefox
keep
crash
every
30minute
And
my
developer
mode
and
normal

take
turn
to

every
30min
Firefox
5303x32
interfere
with
AutoHotkey
Can
you
fix
this
I
rely
on
AutoHotkey
to
map
my
keyboard
because
my
system
is
a
Windows
7
tablet
which
prevent
other
key
mapper
from
work
This
is
a
serious
problem
which
make
Firefox
very
difficult
to
use
This
problem
is
recent
and
I
therefore
believe
that
it
start
when
I
upgrad
to
version
5303
If
you
cant
get
this
fix
can
you
describe
how
to
downgrade
from
version
5303
and
save
my
current
session
How
can
I
use
the
same
account
of
Thunderbird
on
different
computer
at
the
same
time

all
the
email
account
synchronize
I
have
download
mozilla
thunderbird
on
one
desktop
have
a
number
of
email
account
for
business
use
How
can
I
also
log
in
to
other
computer
with
all
the
email
synchronize
at
the
same
time
A
I
do
not
want
to
retype
all
the
email
account
up
to
30
again
after
I
download
mozilla
thunderbird
on
other
computer
can
you
suggest
a
effective
solution
to
me
that
I
can
get
access
to
all

Extremely
high
CPU
and
memory
usage
on
WhatsApp
web
even
with
a
fresh
profile
This
issue
has
been
around
for
a
few
version
Whenever
I
open
webwhatsappcom
without
even
do
anything
Firefox
instantly
use
up
to
1GB
of
RAM
and
10
of
CPU
I
even
create
a
new
profile
but
still
got
the
same
result
I
believe
this
has
something
to
do
with
hardware
acceleration
since
everything
is
normal
in
safe
mode
Bug
when
save
page
in
Firefox
If
I
save
some
page
in
Firefox
example
arquivadorcomlicomerrorbairroshtml
after
click
Save
page
as
I
need
to
switch
the
save
as
option
from
Webpage
complete
to
Webpage
html
If
I
dont
do
this
the
page
will
be
save
incorrectly
since
all
line
of
code
longer
than
a
certain
length
will
be
put
in
a
new
line
So
if
I
have
a
really
long
javascript
comment
the
last
word
might
be
put
in
a
new
line
without
the
double
slash
in
the
begin
thus
break
the
page
The
same
will
happen
to
any
other
long
line
like
ltpa
very
long
paragraph
much
longer
than
this
onep
I
this
just
me
or
is
it
a
bug
in
Firefox
Im
on
Win
7
64

FF
32

I
already

After
several
year
of
use
Firefox
and
enjoy
it
which
I
still
do
I
am
delet
it
because
of
all
the
recent
problem
I
have
had
with
it
so
goodbye
I
enjoy
Firefox
but
of
recent
it
has
become
more
of
a
problem
than
what
it
worth
My
story
is
long
but
I
will
make
it
short
I
live
and
work
in
China
I
had
to
buy
a
Chinese
computer
In
switch
it
over
to
English
they
mess
it
up
plus
you
would
not
believe
all
the
bloatware
they
install
Anyway
I
got
the
free
upgrade
to
Windows
10
and
it
work
well
but
I
still
had
a
lot
of
problem
so
I
just
complete
the
upgrade
to
Windows
10
and
more
of
the
problem
disappear
but
problem
with
Firefox
happen
full
web
page
not
display
right
I
finally
did
a
clean
install
of
Windows
10
which
got
rid
of
all
the
Chinese
program
and
leftover
file
I
download
Firefox
and
it
work
fine
for
1
day
and
then
it
start
again
It
would
not
remember
my
page
visit
I
had
to
sign
in
to
each
site
ie
twitter
many
time
during
the
course
of
a
day
so
i
uninstall
Firefox
and
download
it
again
and
it
work
so
I
thought
It
work
fine
except
some
of
my
site
I
go
to
it
only
render
34
of
the
page
which
I
dont
need
Also
when
I
import
bookmark
and
everything
over
to
Edge
and
Chrome
I
got
my
current
bookmark
but
I
also
got
bookmark
that
I
had
use
on
Windows
7
which
I
delete
a
year
or
so
ago
Figure
that
one
out
So
something
is
amiss
and
I
dont
know
how
to
fix
it
except
buy
a
new
computer
back
in
the
state
I
was
go
to
use
Tor
for
my
back
up
but
that
has
the
same
problem
as
Firefox
so
that
is
out
Anyway
it
on
to
Chrome
Why
wont
my
website
video
load
in
firefox
but
will
load
in
chrome
I
develop
a
website
at
wixcom
There
is
a
video
in
the
website
that
wont
load
when
use
Firefox
However
when
I
use
Chrome
the
video
load
fine
Why
would
be
happen
Also
some
of
the
pics
on
my
website
werent
load
either
I
uninstall
Firefox
and
then
reinstall
it
with
no
change
I
have
the
most
up
to
date
version
of
Firefox
as
well
Why
do
Firefox
often
fail
when
I
try
to
send
a
message
through
AOL
mail
Among
other
problem
Im
often
unable
to
send
message
to
AOL
mail
The
display
say
connect
and
the
wheel
spin
forever
This
happen
often
When
it
happen
I
can
get
around
it
sometime
by
open
another
instance
of
Firefox
and
AOL
mail
and
send
I
also
have
problem
use
various
internet
service
like
bank
when
I
transition
from
one
screen
like
account
to
another
like
transfer
The
connect
display
come
up
and
never
end
My
computer
use
Win

I
have
a
feel
the
problem
are
relate

My
fresh
download
of
FireFox
sit
and
spin
consume
about
40
of
my
CPU
Windows
10
year
old
HP
laptop
Whatsup
I
notice
that
FireFox
was
consume
a
chunk
of
my
CPU
when
seemingly
idle
I
had
just
been
experiment
with
Google
Map
API
and
thought
maybe
that
was
relate
So
I
close
all
tab
and
start
fresh
Still
do
it
Thought
maybe
either
it
was
corrupt
or
I
need
a
fresher
version
of
FireFox
so
I
download
and
install
current
version
from
mozillaorg
download
page
No
change
Still
chew
up
about
40
and
the
only
thing
active
in
FireFox
is
this
question
submission
I
reboot
only
a
little
bit
earlier
this
AM
Ill
try
that
again
and
see
if
that
make
a
difference
UPDATE
I
reboot
again
No
change
Only
one
Firefox
window
open
plus
the
Task
Manager
to
observe
busyness
Only
tab
open
in
FireFox
is
this
update
When
nothing
else
is
active
FireFox
take
abut
40
of
CPU
When
other
thing
go
active
like
maybe
Norton
mak
sure
nothing
is
amiss
follow
a
reboot
it
give
up
some
of
the
CPU
but
then
return
to
about
40
Huh
I
thought
I
upload
another
pic
before
the
UPDATE
but
I
dont
see
it
So
the
second
one
with
the
Processes
view
of
the
Task
Manager
and
Firefox
was
from
a
little
earlier
When
I
kill

TO
THE
DEVELOPERS
Yes
many
people
are
ask
similar
question
but
there
is
no
answer
Its
get
to
the
point
where
Firefox
is
unusable
I
thought
it
was
my
laptop
but
I
use

and
it
fast
and
no
problem
To
the
developer
Please
do
something
I
would
think
that
you
would
be
embarrass
with
the
Firefox
browser
It
use
to
be
my
favorite

How
do
I
save
my
contact
list
session
restore
in
private
window
Yesterday
I
close
my
FF
v540
on
Win7
x64
Pro
and
later
during
the
day
I
open
a
private
window
with
the
right
click
on
FF
icon
on
the
taskbar
New
Private
Window
I
assume
that
this
action
wont
delete
sessionstorej
file
coz
private
window
dont
save
session
by
themself
After
finish
my
search
I
close
the
private
window
until
now
Today
I
open
my
FF
and
there
was
no
Restore
Previous
Session
button
I
looke
at
the
MenuHistory
and
there
was
not
any
restore
option
beside
tab
list
After
that
I
copy
the
backup
file
and
try
again
to
prove
my
theory
and
it
happen
again
Conclusion
Opening
just
a
private
window
will
delete
the
last
sessionstorej
file
In
my
opinion
that
is
very
illogical
because
private
window
dont
store
the
last
session
so
they
shouldnt
have
delete
the
last
session
either

go

Hei
Kysyn
täällä
tällaista
ongelmaa
Käytin
pitkään
Firefoxin
32bittistä
selainta
Ja
nyt
sitten
tässä
vähän
aikaa
sitten
päätin
siirtyä
64bittiseen
selaimeen
sie
Firefoxin
viimeisin
versio
Poistin
ensin
32bittisen
selaimen
perusteellisesti
mutta
tätä
ennen
tietenkin
otin
booksmarkit
talteen
Sitten
asensin
64bittisen
selaimen
Ja
sitten
asensin
Adobe
Flash
Playeristä
viimeisimmän
version
Koska
pelaan
erilaisia
pelejä
Facebookissa
kuten
Candy
Crush
Saga
ja
erityisesti
Angry
Birds
Friends
Tournament
peliä
kumpikin
käyttää
Flash
Playeriä
Candy

käynnistyi

eipä
käynnistynytkään
vaan
heittää
seuraavanlaisen
virheilmoituksen
This

not

Ja
virheilmoitus
sie
keskellä
mustaa
ruutua
Laitan
vielä
kuvan
esimerkkinä
Kysyin
Facebookissa
Roviolta
ja
Angry
Birds
sivulla
tuosta
ongelmasta
Mutta
jostain
syystä
EIVÄT
vaivaudu
ede
vastamaan
vaikka
muuten
kyllä
tuntuvat
vastailevan
toisten
kysymyksiin
ihmeellistä
Joten
en
voinut
muuta
kuin
palata
takaisin
32bittiseen
versioon
ja
Firefox
54xx
versioon
Ja
poistaa
64bittinen
selain
Ellei
sitten
joku
bittiguru
ystävällisesti
keksi
ratkaisua
että
miten
tuo
pelin
saa
pelittämään
64bittisellä
selaimella
Vai
onko
niin
että
Rovio
EI
OLE
vaivautunut
ottamaan
huomioon
64bittisiä
selaimia
ollenkaan
kun
vertailu
kohtana
Candy
Crush
Saga
toimii
kyllä
hienosti
I
download
the
latest

yesterday
and
now
I

On

Ive

Ive
use

since
single
digit

So
disappoint
have
to
use

to

to
ask
this
question
So
how
can
I
compare

So

I
dont
have

clue
Both

Could
Firefox
handle
Form
PrePopulation
with
Saved
UsernamePassword
Better
I
just
saw
firefox
prepopulate
the
Last
Name
and
Password
field
of
my
Create
Account
form
with
a
save
usernameemail
and
password
respectively
Its
very
strange
to
see
the
Last
Name
field
of
a
Create
Account
form
to
be
prepopulate
with
an
Email
address
Here
are
the
detail
I
am
use
Firefox
540
64bit
on
MacOS
Sierra
I
open
this
web
page
httpsaccounthallmarkcomcrsignup
I
am
a
developer
for
this
website
The
problem
I
found
is
the
Last
Name
lastName
field
was
prepopulate
with
an
email
address
by
Firefox
I
check
all
of
the
HTTP
request
and
the
email
address
was
not
in
any
of
them
The
Password
field
was
prepopulate
as
well
I
think
what
is
happen
is
Firefox
detect
the
Password
field
either
by
the
attribute
name=password
or
by
type=password
then
it
found
a
save
password
that
I
had
use
to
sign
in
to
accounthallmarkcom
earlier
Finally
it
prepopulate
the
password
field
and
the
input
field
that
immediately
preceed
it
which
happen
to
be
a
Last
Name
field
with
the
save
username
and
password
This
is
weird
behavior
that
will
confuse
our
QA
team
and
user
I
dont
know
if
there
is
a
better
way
for
Firefox
to
prepopulate
form
perhap
only
prepopulate
input
element
with
type=text
and
name=username
or
something
like
that
but
the
current
behavior
is
confuse

What
and
where
is
this
At

have

Web
Extensions
Problem
that
I
have
is
with
Firefox
Dev
Edition
55
and
multiple
web
extension
addon
Roboform
AdBlock
etc
Say
Im
open
some
page
in
Firefox
from
external
link
for
example
httpswwwfacebookcomthemeltingpotrestaurantsphotosa2634049880271421474566416302710155538922443028
Page
open
however
neither
Roboform
nor
AdBlock
is
active
Next
step
Im
open
SAME
Facebook
page
in

of
same
Firefox
Now
Roboform
and
AdBlock
work
I
feel
that
there
is
some
latency
in
activation
of
web
extension
in
Firefox
So
to
use
them
I
have
to
open
page
wait
some
second
then
open
same
page
again
in
new
tab
Why
are

open

some
reason
when
launch
firefox
youtube
and
facebook

despite
have
set
a

of

I
believe
this
may
be
a

import

or
something
of
that
nature
as
Im
999
certain
there
no
extension
to
blame
for
it
Nothing

seem
to
be

either

No

but
they
work
in
other
browser
I
have
three
browser
Firefox
Chrome
and
Opera
all

I
use
ZenMate

Since
latest
update

i
just
cant
use
any
vpnZenMate
or
otherwise
on

They
just
dont
work
Intersting
thing
is
that
same
vpn

perfectly
fine
in
my
chromeopera
in
same
HP
laptopwindow

o
and
college
wifi
Basically
problem
is
specifically
about
firefox
I
have
unistall
and
reinstall
firefox
from
sctrachmany
time
It
doesnt
solve
anything
There
is
also
the
problem
that
i
constantly
need
to
prove
that
i
am
human
Same
site
doesnt
ask
me
to
prove
that
in
chrome
for
example
It
has
became
irritate
honestly
I
love
firefox
and
i
am
use
to
it
but
it
has
became
downright
unusable
since
latest
update
What
should
i
do
I
clon
my

a
hard
drive
and
now
my
cooky

to
Beaglebones
Odroids
anything
else
that
boot
from
an
SD
card
My
cooky
were
stor
on
the
device

Everything

SD
card
are
slower
more
limite
in
size
and
by
some
account
less
reliable
than
hard
drive
Its
fairly
trivial
to
use
an
external
USB
hard
drive
instead
Everythings

ANYTHING

In

there
is
a

preview

chrome
instead
firefox
but
it

pitty
because
I

very
much
Maybe
you
have
a
solution
in
such
a
way
I
keep
continu
with

I
add
that
the

problem
happen
with

but
with
some
difference
1
Mozilla

the
nature
of
problem
while

do

Mozilla
freez
itself
while

crash
and
ask

to

In
a
dialog
box
Exploer
tell
me
that
the
problem
is
something
call
AppHangB1
or
AppHangProB1
follow
by
a
sery
of
block
everyone
with
number
and
letter
Mozilla
doesnt
tell
me
nothing
about
the
nature
of
the
problem
but
as
now
the
problem
is
quite
similar
with
the
two

I
think
that
Mozilla
could
have
be
affect
by
the

too
I

Kirjautuminen
synctilille
ja
pocketiin
onnistuu
mutta
ei
support
sivuille
Onko
supporttili
eri
kuin
synctili
Hei
Aloiti
juuri
Firefoxin
käytön
ja
loin
ensimmäisenä
synctilin
Kirjautuminen
synctilin
tunnuksilla
ei
kuitenkaan
onnistu
esim
tänne
support
sivustoille
Support
sivusto
ilmoitti
kylläkin
että
synctilini
sähköpostiosoite
on
jo
käytössä
mutta
salasana
ei
sie
toiminut
Uutta
supporttiliä
en
sie
voinut
luoda
synctilini
sähköpostilla
koska
se
sie
oli
jo
olemassa
Yritys
nollata
supporttilin
salasana
johtaa
sähköpostiin
tulleen
linkin
kautta
synctililleni
ja
mahdollistaa
synctilini
salasanan
vaihtamisen
mitä
en
halua
tehdä
koska
se
sie
toimii
ja
ty
vaikka
lakkaisi
toimimasta
sekin
Tämä
on
hiukan
kiinalainen
yhtälö
mutta
haluaisin
nyt
vain
aluksi
varmistaa
kokeneemmilta
käyttäjiltä
että
pitäisikö
normaalitilanteessa
synctilille
ja
supporttilille
päästä
samoilla
tunnuksilla
Pelkästään
tästä
tiedosta
olisi
paljon
apua
ja
säästäisi
turhalta
sompailulta
Kiitokset
etukäteen
tiedosta

Why
wont
Firefox
download
file
from
Comodo
sandbox
any
more
Ive
been
run
Firefox
in
Comodo
Internet
Securitys
Virtual
Desktop
sandbox
environment
for
month
and
download
ofx
file
from
my
bank
every
week
But
2
weekend
ago
this
suddenly
stop
work
I
contact
my
bank
and
their
first
response
was
Are
you
use
Firefox
Try
Chrome
instead
So
I
did
and
it
work
Further
test
show
that
it
had
become
impossible
to
download
the
majority
of
file
type
pdf
mp3
etc
etc
In
fact
the
only
thing
I
did
manage
to
download
was
a
simple
copy
of
a
web
page
The
symptom
are
that
when
I
click
the
Download
arrow
in
the
menu
bar
the
download
dialog
open
but
as
soon
as
I
select
the
Save
option
irrespective
of
what
default
directory
has
been
set
a
yellow
spot
appear
beside
the
Download
arrow
in
the
menu
bar
and
click
the
arrow
display
the
download
as
Failed
The
download
still
work
fine
when
Firefox
is
run
outside
the
sandbox
but
I
then
I
lose
my
security
protection
Chrome
work
fine
inside
or
outside
the
sandbox
so
it
look
as
if
the
problem
is
down
to
some
kind
of
adverse
interaction
between
CIS
and
Firefox
result
from
a
recent
program
update
A
of
today
I
have
the
latest
update
to
CIS
plus
the
latest

of

Hi
kevinthekingsson
your
issue
sound
totally
unrelate
to
a
video
download
extension
not
work
so
please
start
a
new
question
A
a
note
to
provide
more
context
when
you
click
a
link
or
button
that
trigger
a
download
Firefox
start
download
the
file
to
the
Windows
TEMP
folder
After
you
specify
a
save
location
Firefox
will
move
it
there
once
the
download
is
complete
On
the
other
hand
if
you
choose
an
application
to
open
the
file
the
file
will
remain
in
the
TEMP
folder
If
neither
of
those
work
in
your
sandbox
check
with
Comodo
on
whether
any
configuration
change
are
need
If
only
the
file
move
is
a
problem
Im
not
sure
what
cause
the
new
incompatibility
Firefox
has
done
it
that
way
for
year
blockquote
A
a
result
Ive
report
back
on
this
issue
to
the
Comodo
forum
and
also
run
some
additional
test
Ive
found
I
get
the
same
error
regardless
of
which
download
option
I
choose
Nothing
appear
to
happen
until
I
select
either
Open
or
Save
and
if
I
look
in
the
WindowsTemp
folder
in
the
interim
nothing
appear
to
have
been
save
in
either
the
root
or
in
VTRoot
But
as
soon
as
I
select
Open
or
Save
the
spot
appear
beside
the
download
arrow
which
bounce
up
and
down
a
couple
of
time
and
click
on
it
then
display
the
Failed
message
If
I
shut
down
Firefox
and
restart
the
Failed

are
still
list
and
it
appear
that
Firefox
briefly
reattempt
them
on
startup
as
the
Failure
message
are
update
to
the
current
time
Ive
been
wonder
if
there
is
some
kind
of
permission
issue
I
have
been
log
in
with
admin
privilege
but
when
I
attempt
to
view
some
file
or
folder
I
am
still
ask
to
confirm
before
proceed
Or
could
Firefox
be
attempt
to
directly
access
the
virtualise
download
directory
I
normally
have
Show

have
notice

Firefoxs
overflow
CSS
property
value
default
to
mozhiddenunscrollable
A
can
be
seen
in
httpshgmozillaorgmozillacentralannotatetiplayoutstyleresformscssl265
since
March
2007
this
formscss
file
inside
omnija
has
been
set
the
select
tag
overflow
CSS
property
value
to
mozhiddenunscrollable
thus
contradict
the
documentation
that
say
that
the
default
value
for
this
property
is
visible
Heres
an
example
represent
one
of
the
problem
that
come
from
have
formscss
define
overflow
mozhiddenunscrollable
for
select
HTML
tag
Lets
say
we
have
the
follow
CSS
rule
flexcontainer
display
flex
justifycontent
spacebetween
width
12em
inputtype=text
width
15em
And
the
follow
HTML
structure
label
Foo
divflexcontainer
select
option
Value
1
inputtype=text
With
overflow
visible
the
select
element
of
this
structure
would
be
fully
display
but
with
the
overflow
mozhiddenunscrollable
define
by
formscss
the
select
element
is
only
partially
display
With
this
be
said
the
question
is
is
the
documentation
wrong
or
there
just
a
lack
of
information
regard
rule
for
specific
CSS
selector
And
the
solution
to
this
problem
is
as
simple
as
overwrite
this
specific
rule

creep

Firefox
ei
halua
enää
ladata
tiedostoja
Ongelma
alkoi
eilen
Silloin
en
vielä
ihmetellyt
asiaa
ja
ajattelin
sen
johtuvan
vain
siitä
yhdestä
sivusta
Tänään
olen
sitten
yrittänyt
ladata
kaikenlaisia
tiedostoja
useilta
sivuilta
ja
yksikään
lataus
ei
suostu
käynnistymään
automaattisesti
Olen
tässä
sitten
koko
aamun
yrittänyt
löytyy
ratkaisua
ongelmaani
ja
kokeillut
configissa
muokkauksia
sekä
muita
neuvoja
Näyttää
siltä
ettei
tämä
häviä
itsekseen
vaan
on
tullut
jäädäkseen
Ongelma
alkoi
sie
aivan
yllättäen
ja
en
ole
tehnyt
koneellani
mitään
ihmeellistä
mitä
en
olisi
tehnyt
Firefoxilla
vuosikausia
Ongelma
ei
varsinaisesti
estä
lataamasta
tiedostoja
kokonaan
Pystyn
edelleen
pakottamaan
Firefoxin
lataamaan
tiedoston
painamalla
hiiren
oikealla
nappulalla
linkkiä
ja
valitsemalla
sieltä
lataa
tiedosto
tietokoneelle
vaihtoehdon
Sillä
tavalla
homma
toimii
ihan
niinkuin
ennenkin
mutta
valitettavasti
noin
99
sivuista
ei
anna
tähän
mahdollisuutta
Tämä
estää
kokonaan
käyttämästä
Firefoxia
En
pysty
tarkasti
sanomaan
missä
ongelma
lopullisesti
on
Firefox
ei
vaan
yksinkertaisesti
suostu
ilman
suoraa
käskyä
lataamaan
mitään
tietokoneelleni
Firefox
lähettää
kuitenkin
signaalin
sivustoille
että
haluaisin
ladata
tämän
tiedoston
mutta
se
ei
avaa
ikkunaa
valitsemaan
tiedoston
latauksen
sijainnille
tai
suostu
muutenkaan
siirtämään
mitään
koneelle
automaattisesti
Jos
yritän
ladata
rar
tiedoston
Firefox
avaa
vaan
välilehdeen
sen

eikä
tee
mitään
sen

Jos
yritän
ladata
jotain

ei
Firefox
reagoi

mitenkään

Its
not
uncommon
for
Firefox
to
crash
in
the
background
on
my
Mac
when
I
switch
to
a
different
application
It
doesnt
seem
to
matter
what
site
I
have
open
how
many
tab
etc
It
might
be
relate
to
YouTube
+
headphone
but
that
doesnt
force
it
to
crash
every
time
and
it
not
been
the
only
time
Firefox
has
crash
That
bug
however
was
supposedly
fix
in
a
previous
version
This
crash
seem
to
happen
about
every
three
day
Ive
try
this
in
safe
mode
without
crash
but
unfortunately
I
use
Firefox
for
work
so
I
cant
leave
it
in
safe
mode
for
that
long
I
also
cannot
replicateforce
the
crash
This
had
happen
before
and
I
remove
every
extension
It
still
happen
I
install
them
back
oneatatime
and
it
continue
to
happen
Maybe
there
an
installation
issue
and
I
need
to
somehow
move
my

and
such
to
a

Not
sure
of
the
best
way
to
do
that

adobe
flash
not
work
on

only
html
player
is
default
how
to
change
it
flash
since
in
html
the
data
is
unnecessarly
get
wast
by
buffer
at
360p
after
an
update
for
flash
now
flash
has
stop
work
completely
for

and
normal
play
default
is
html
which
take
lot

If
i
change
the
config
in

in
aboutconfig
for
media
type
and
enforce
the
flash
instead
of
html
then
none
of

is
open
the

content
why
need
flash
Html
consume
lot
of

and
it
jitter
and
it
buffer
the
whole
media
without
permission
and
deflaut
quality
rate
is
360p
which
cannot
be
change
and
unnecessarily
cost
the

overflow
indirectly
cost
the

the

Firefox
hang
when
multiple
tab
are
be
load
only
in
normal
window
Firefox
hang
exclusively
whenever
I
try
to
open
and
load
multiple
tab
It
never
happen
in
other
situation
This
happen
only
in
the
normal
window
and
doesnt
happen
in
the
private
window
It
is
also
slower
in
the
normal
window
than
in
the
private
window
Maybe
the
key
of
my
problem
lay
in
the
difference
between
how
normal
and
private
window
work
It
doesnt
only
happen
when
there
are
manysay
more
than
20
tab
are
already
open
It
also
hang
when
I
fresh
start
the
Firefox
with
no
preopen
tab
I
try
every
measure
which
Mozilla
support
provide
officially
This
include
safe
mode
refresh
the
browserall
the
set
are
now
at
default
turn
off
hardware
acceleration
etc
Nothing
has
work
I
dont
think
that
my
computer
memory
and
CPU
can
be
a
source
of
the
problem
I
have
16GB
ram
i75500U
processor
which
is
more
than
enough
to
run
Firefox
of
course
And
I
dont
run
any
resource
exhaust
heavy
program
I
just
use
browser
and
some
wordprocessor
Plus
this
never
happen
with
Chrome
and
chrome
consume
even
more
memory
and
CPU
resource
than
Firefox
Conclusively
Firefox
doesnt
occupy
so
much
memory
or
CPU
resource
when
it
hang
Actually
I
prefer
the
Firefox
to
occupy
more
resource
if
it
can
avoid
this
annoy
hang
problem
I
have
no
idea
what
could
be
the
source
of
the
problem
Maybe
I
should
just
be
patient
with
the
problem
until
next
major
update
to
version
57
If
anyone
had
a
similar
problem
and
fix
it
please
let
me
know
After
I
wrote
this
question
I
alter
configuration
to
allow
Firefox
to
load
multiple
tab
in
the
background
by
switch
browsersessionstorerestore_on_demand
set
in
the
aboutconfig
to
false
from
truedefault
So
far
the
browser
certainly
use
more
memory
but
dont
hang
Why
cant
I
get
the
Personas
Rotator
to
use
only
my
favorite
I
have
several
persona
designate
as
favorite
They
use
to
be
the
only
one
display
when
I
activate
the
Rotator
For
about
a
year
now
any
persona
is
display
but
not
my
favorite
Ive
try
ad
other
Persona
addon
and
nothing
has
help
I
have
to
go
into
Personas
Plus
and
select
My
Favorites
then

from

it

I

How

Ive

that
while

it
still
report
a
valid

it
still
pass

test
it
even
download

before

it
For

phase

Chrome

detect
Flash
has
been
disable
for
a

is
quite
easy
the
version
is
report
as
zero
The
only
way
left
I
can
think
to
detect
this
is
quite
inelegant
Attempt
to
load
a
SWF
that
communicate
to
JS
and
then
wait
to
see
if
that
communication
come
or
not
My
need
is
that
we
need
to
know
if
Flash
is
be
block
for
our
user
and
then
provide
them
with
more
explicit
instruction
as
to
what
go
on
and
how
to
resolve
it
for

train
I
there

GIFV
Corruption
and
Display
Driver
Crash
on
FF
55+
Hoping
someone
has
a
solution
for
me
here
as
Im
out
of
idea
Since
upgrade
to
5501
I
notice
that
some
gif
file
would
show
corrupt
output
on
playback
When
I
dug
into
it
I
found
that
it
was
only
gifv
file
cause
this
to
happen
Additionally
I
found
that
if
I
view
multiple
gifv
file
at
once
my
display
driver
will
crash
and
reset
Also
view
a
gifv
file
concurrently
with
a
YouTube
video
result
in
display
artifact
on
the
video
First
thing
I
try
was
disable
hardware
acceleration
which
resolve
the
problem
but
this
introduce
some
ugly
screen
tear
when
scrol
I
then
refresh
Firefox
create
a
new
profile
and
then
finally
blew
the
whole
install
away
to
make
sure
that
there
wasnt
some
aboutconfig
set
responsible
Tested
at
each
step
and
verify
the
same
behavior
Bumped
the
install
to
the
beta
branch
same
behavior
Rolled
everything
back
to
5401
and
the
problem
is
fix
no
corruption
with
hardware
acceleration
enable
Normally
between
disable
hardware
acceleration
and
dump
my
FF
profileinstall
I
would
have
try
a
driver
update
Unfortunately
this
laptop
rock
an
Intel
HD
3000
which
is
no
longer
support
and
thus
has
no
driver
update
available
My
choice
seem
to
be
stick
with
5401
use
5501
wout
hw
acceleration
or
use
the
ESR
branch
The
ESR
branch
doesnt
have
the
problem
but
is
much
slower
than
the
latest
branch
so
that
not
ideal
The
whole
thing
seem
ty
to
some
change
in
the
way
that
hw
acceleration
work
between
5501
and
older
version
of
Firefox
I
there
some
aboutconfig
set
I
can
use
to
make
5501
hw
acceleration
work
like
it
did
in
5401
Example
file
that
exhibit
the
issue
httpiimgurcom64X8JOtgifv
And
here
what
it
look
like
in
5501+
with
hw
acceleration
enable

The

unsettle

Firefox
ha
reiniciado
mi

elimino
me
extensione
y

Hoy
abrí
el
navegador
Mozilla
Firefox
ante
usaba
una
extensión
llamada
CookieSwap
la
cual
me
permitia
tener
diferente
usuario
desde
el
mismo
navegador
de
Mozilla
Firefox
Y
hoy
al
abrirlo
me
encuentro
con
la
sorpresa
de
que
no
está
la
extensión
y
que
mi
historial
y
la
ventana
que
tenía
ya
no
están
E
como
si
lo
hubiera
desinstalado
y
vuelto
a
instalar
desde
el
principio
coomo
si
se
hubiera
RESETEADO
No
sé
si
fue
porque
se
instalo
otra
versión
o
qué
paso
pero
no
me
gustó
para
nada
que
hicieran
esto
ya
que
normalmente
uso
Chrome
pero
esta
vez
decidí
usar
FIREFOX
para
realizar
esto
y
me
encuentro
con
esta
broma
de
pésimo
gusto
The
page
graphics
turn
light
blue
periodically
The
search
bar
is
still
active
but
the
graphics
are
all
light
blue
This
only
happen
on
Facebook
Any
idea
The
start
of
this
is
not
associate
with
any
update
or
install
I
just
start
use
Facebook
recently
and
I
access
it
through
the
browser
para
registrarme
Porque
no
puedo
acceder
a
mi
facebock
New
update
miss
the
HTML
preview
option
in
the
network
tab
For
a
dev
this
is
a
huge
issue
as
any
report
with
a
stack
trace
has
to
be
copy
and
past
I
realize
this
is
a
bug
with
the
latest
build
but
I
cant
see
any
report
of
progress
I
honestly
chose
Firefox
over
Chrome
to
do
dev
work
on
web
app
bc
it
was
so
much
faster
to
get
bug
info
from
stack
trace
on
render
page
like
those
from
Laravel
Whoops
etc
Please
let
me
know
or
at
least
please
add
me
to
the
group
hop
this
is
fix
on
a
resolution
Until
then
I
have
downgrad
to
54
first
time
Ive
ever
downgrad
Firefox
been
with
you
since
the
begin
And

Only

soon
as

the
problem
return
Firefox

My

on

at
random
time
The
close

all
turn

like
if

of
a

bell
sound
I
wont
be
able
to
continue
typ
till
I
click
on
the

again
This
doesnt
happen
with
other
browser
or
application
It
doesnt
happen
on
every
website
I
use
Here
is
a
video
httpsyoutube3MENSCLeGYU
Why
do
Firefox
slow
my
whole
OS
Firefox
is
slow
on
my
computer
even
if
neither
my
RAM
nor
CPU
is
sonsume
I
made
test
while
use
less
than
20
of
each
When
I
talk
about
be
slow
I
mean
that
even
my
pointer
is
slow
It
lag
and
blink
from
one
part
of
the
screen
to
another
one
just
as
if
I
move
it
but
without
display
any
animation
It
seem
some
sort
of
frame
skip
but
I
dont
really
know
if
that
is
the
reason
This
apply
to
everything
not
just
my
pointer
If
something
else
run
on
my
computer
let
say
a
VoIP
chat
that
said
chat
has
the
same
issue
audio
package
are
not
play
until
the
pointer
start
move
again
If
I
try
to
write
something
on
a
forum
or
in
a
firefox
page
the
text
I
write
is
not
display
as
I
write
it
but
much
like
the
pointer
few
frame
after
I
write
it
and
every
letter
I
wrote
is
display
at
the
same
time
Everything
only
happen
when
Firefox
is
the
active
window
If
it
run
in
background
everything
goe
smoothly
If
not
for
that
Firefox
run
pretty
well
It
doesnt
crash
it
load
page
it
play
video
etc
However
have
everything
run
slower
than
usual
is
quite
annoy
he
site
use
HTTP
Strict
Transport
Security
HSTS
to
specify
that
Firefox
may
only
connect
to
it
securely
A
a
result
it
is
not
possible
to
add
an
exception
We
are
use
a
ucc
cert
where
the
san
domain
do
not
use
the
www
In
firefox
if
the
alternate
is
typ
in
ex
wwwdomain
we
are
not
able
to
get
the
the
browser
to
redirect
to
correct
side
of
cert
httpsdomain
it
goe
to
httpswwwdomain
which
is
not
cover
by
cert
We
are
use

How
can
I
disable
Tabs
Special
Abilities
when
draggingtear
First
Im
not
interest
in
disable
Tab
Tearing
I
love
be
able
to
drag
a
tab
out
of
one
window
and
create
a
new
window
What
I
am
interest
in
though
is
disable
any
of
the
other
special
ability
of
a
drag
tab
I
dont
know
what
that
call
though
and
I
cant
find
it
when
Googling
All
I
can
find
is
people
who
want
to
disable
tear
altogether
A
one
example
if
I
have
VLC
open
in
Windows
and
I
drag
a
tab
out
of
a
Firefox
5401
64bit
window
and
happen
to
land
over
the
VLC
window
it
wont
drop
the
tab
and
open
a
new
window
It
feel
like
Firefox
want
to
interact
with
VLC
somehow
I
just
want
my
tab
to
be
tab
I
dont
ever
want
them
to
interact
with
other
part
of
the
OS
If
I
DO
want
to
interact
with
other
part
of
the
OS
then
I
grab
the
URL
in
the
Address
Bar
and
drag
that
instead
Any
advice
Thanks

I
would

to
be
able

browser
on
my

rather
than
have
to
use
the

app
Since
the
latest
update
to
Firefox
47
I
lost
access
to
the
site
The
Facebook
Messenger
page
redirect
me
to
the
Google
Play
store
to
download
the
Messenger
app
I
there
any
way
to
regain
access
to
the

I
would
prefer
not
have
to
download
any
more
application
than
I
have
to
for
both
convenience
privacy
and
security
sake
how

auto

How

WHY
Why
I
start

after
the

it
now
look
like
a
Chrome
browser
Can
I
go
back
to
the

Can
we
get
a
status
bar
on
full
screen
mode
I
LOVE
the
full
screen
mode
that
you
guy
have
for
us
I
there
anyway
we
can
get
a
status
bar
that
pop
up
in
the
lower
left
corner
when
it
go
to
a
new
address
It
would
be
great
if
it
would
disappear
once
it
is
finish
load
too
For
me
it
would
make
the
full
screen
feature
that
I
now
use

How
to
make
the
Firefox
show
a
local
indexhtml
instead
of
a
directory
list
I
have
a
set
of
HTML
file
on
my
disk
and
I
want
to
browse
them
with
Firefox
without
a
web
server
The
page
dont
have
any
dynamic
content
and
view
each
HTML
page
work
fine
include
image
CSS
etc
However
these
HTML
page
have
link
to
each
other
and
click
on
them
do
not
alway
work
due
to
the
follow
issue
some
page
are
name
indexhtml
and
instead
of
the
link
link
to
a
name
contain
indexhtml
they
link
to
directory
name
end
in
If
the
whole
set
of
page
which
it
directory
structure
was
copy
on
a
web
server
everything
would
work
as
the
web
server
would
map
URL
of
directory
to
the
indexhtml
page
When
use
Firefox
locally
that
however
is
not
the
case
and
such
link
end
up
show
the
directory
list
My
question
is
I
there
a
set
somewhere
to
make
link
to
local
directory
instead
go
to
a
file
indexhtml
instead

Website
Notifications
Disappearing
on
Mac
This
is
mostly
a
query
around
the
way
web
push
notification
work
I
use
wwwwrikecom
for
their
project
management
software
I
will
get
a
push
notification
to
let
me
know
when
someone
edit
or
update
a
task
on
their
site
If
I
click
this
notification
straight
away
it
behave
as
expect
and
direct
me
to
the
update
task
If
I
miss
the
notification
though
it
will
not
be
in
my
Macs
notification
centre
it
disappear
completely
Now
I
alway
have
a
Firefox
window
open
with
wrikecom
load
up
already
is
this
why
the
notification
disappear
immediately
because
Firefox
has
seen
that
I
am
on
the
website
that
sent
the
push
notification
and
it
therefore
dismiss
said
notification
If
so
is
there
any
way
of
edite
this
functionality
If
Im
on
a
call
or
not
in
front
of
my
computer
for
a
second
and
miss
the
notification
then
I
have
no
way
of
get
back
to
it
without
go
to
the
site
and
track
down
the
change
manually
Thanks

Including

Of

to
suffer
Once

finally

culprit

seem
to
be

up
a
lot
and
I
have
to
go
to
the
task
manager
to
close
it
and
start
over
I
use

How
do
I
fix

these

remain
intact

sent
but
sometime
when
the

is
view
later
on
the
term
inline
image
appear
in
place
of
the
image
itself
I
prefer
Firefox
over
Chrome
But
I
understand
that
Chrome
because
of
it
connection
with
Google
has
overcome
this
problem
I
there
a
similar
fix
for
Firefox
So
that
I
can
continue
use
my
Gmail
on
Firefox

I

over
a

any

I

Firefox
page
disappear
when
scrol
Suddenly
a
week
ago
possibly
after
a
Windows
7
Pro
update
I
start
have
problem
with
Firefox
scrol
or
even
just
move
the
cursor
or
click
or
alternatively
use
Page
Down
on
keyboard
would
result
in
a
complete
blankout
of
the
screen
about
50
of
the
time
This
is
SPECIFIC
to
Firefox
This
problem
do
not
happen
in
Chrome
or
Explorer
let
alone
any
other
program
type
I
did
all
these
thing
to
no
avail
reinstall
Firefox
troubleshot
display
download
driver
try
a
different
monitor
try
more
update
from
Windows
replace
the
graphics
card
etc
I
finally
try
a
System
Restore
successful
but
that
did
not
fix
the
problem
at
all
So
I
Undoed
the
Restore
or
try
to
anyway
It
crash
my
Dell
Precision
prograde
workstation
just
over
a
year
old
It
crash
so
badly
it
is
now
at
a
computer
repair
shop
and
they
were
able
to
fish
my
operate
system
from
blackscreen
oblivion
and
they
see
the
same
Firefox
problem
and
are
just
as
perplex
as
me
about
why
it
should
happen
I
like
Firefox
enough
to
have
gone
through
all
this
day
of
frustration
no
computer
etc
but
so
far
for
all
my
effort
it
hundre
of
dollar
wast
and
a
week
of
reinstal
all
my
program
Ugh
Anyone
have
similar
experience
or
better
yet
fix
Thanks

Certificate
I
am
use
a
3rd
party
application
to
transfer
client
information
from
one
system
to
a
web
portal
Once
I
transfer
the
information
I
click
a
button
in
the
3rd
party
application
which
open
a
link
to
a
client
file
At
this
stage
FireFox
is
suppose
to
prompt
me

as
I
set
the
Certificate
to
use
Client
Authentication
Internet
Explorer
work
however
Google
Chrome
and
Mozilla
FireFox
did
not
I
would
have
expect
Google
Chrome
to
work
once
Internet
Explorer
start
work
as
they
use
the
same
Certificate
Store
This
problem
has
occur
on

are
no
longer
prompt

the
SSL
Certificate
I

ay

iMacrosu
çalıştırarak

Kardeşimin

Biraz

Ne

uğraşsamda
simgeyi

Bunun
ardından
iMacrosu
oradan
açıp

çalıştım
fakat
eskisi

çalışmıyordu
Sisteminde

Yani
bir
daha
iMacrostan

Sürekli

Hello
Ok
So
I
have
a
pretty
specific
problem
which
only
happen
on
Firefox
and
not
other
browser
that
I
have
on
my
computer
Basically
Youtube
video
will
not
play
on
any
website
other
than
Youtube
For
example
if
I
go
to
youtubecom
I
can
play
any
video
without
any
issue
However
if
someone
put
a
youtube
video
on
another
website
for
example
twitter
or
9gagtv
then
I
cant
play
them
I
dont
get
an
error
message
or
anything
Just
an
empty
space
where
the
video
box
should
be
see
attachment
Did
anyone
ever
had
this
issue
before
The
only
addon
that
I
have
are
adblock
plus
but
i
believe
the
issue
was
present
even
before
I
install
this
and

not
solve

issue

Issue
play
video
at
360p
in
Firefox
5502
Ive
had
an
issue
with
Firefox
that
Ive
notice
only
since
I
update
to
Firefox
55
Ive
notice
that
when
a
video
is
play
at
360p
whether
it
on
YouTube
Vimeo
or
wherever
the
color
become
completely
distort
and
a
large
vertical
green
bar
appear
in
the
centerleft
part
of
the
video
I
change
a
lot
of
the
internal
set
in
Firefox
to
personalize
it
but
Ive
never
experience
this
issue
I
decid
I
would
look
into
it
and
try
to
troubleshoot
it
myself
before
come
here
and
here
what
Ive
gather
so
far
1
This
do
not
occur
on
any
other
browser
nor
do
it
occur
on
any
other
quality
set
eg
480p
2
The
issue
is
not
cause
by
any
of
my
addon
as
Ive
disable
all
of
them
and
it
still
happen
whenever
I
set
the
quality
of
a
video
to
360p
3
The
only
thing
that
has
successfully
prevent
the
issue
is
Safe
Mode
but
I
have
no
idea
what
it
is
about
Safe
Mode
that
cause
the
video
to
go
back
to
normal
4
Ive
refresh
Firefox
about
3
time
and
each
time
I
test
it
before
and
after
I
restor
my
addon
and
set
and
it
work
fine
but
the
next
time
I
would
start
Firefox
it
would
start
occur
again
Ive
basically
come
here
as
a
last
resort
I
believe
it
one
of
my
set
that
cause
this
but
I
have
no
idea
which
one
Ive
try
reverse
a
bunch
of
them
to
see
what
was
cause
it
but
with
no
permanent
solution
Any
idea

gpu
overheat
result
in
BSOD
when
use
livefeed
webcam
Shortly
after
the
last
FF
upgrade
5502
I
start
get
a
BSOD
when
use
webcam
The
screen
just
went
black
after
a
few
minute
and
display
no
error
message
My
research
took
me
to
open
hardware
monitor
which
i
download
Everything
work
just
fine
until
I
activate
a
webcam
either
outgo
or
income
Thats
when
I
could
see
the
GPU
temperature
steadily
climb
until
somewhere
around
220
degreesF
and
suddenly
there
was
the
BSOD
If
I
stop
the
webcam
before
I
reach
that
temperatutre
level
I
could
the
temperature
get
lower
Using
all
the
same
stuff
I
never
had
a
problem
until
around
the
time
of
the
last
update
I
cleane
up
around
the
fan
but
they
really
were
not
that
dusty
I
was
think
about
replac
the
graphics
card
but
first
try
run
on
Microsoft
Edge
Absolutely
no
problem
Temperatures
remain
low
fan
speed
stay
low
fan
got
up
to
100
as
it
heate
up
when
use
FF
and
could
use
he
webcam
for
an
hour
with
no
BSOD
minimal
rise
in
GPU
and
minimal
fan
speed
Granted
my
computer
technical
knowledge
is
limite
but
I
can
interpret
the
obvious
conclusion
that
my
computer
is
not
at
fault
since
GPU
overheate
and
the
result
BSOD
only
happen
when
use
webcam
with
FF
and
everything
work
perfectly
when
use
MS
EDGE
I
have
no
problem
play
video
just
with
livestreame
webcam

comment

Why
sound
do
not
work
on
lightweight
Linux
I
beg
you
to
enable
ALSA
by
default
and
maintain
it
work
for
the
sake
of
lightweight
community
If
you
want
to
avoid
multiple
audio
backend
you
are
do
it
wrong
once
PulseAudio
depend
on
ALSA
have
you
ever
try
to
uninstall
libasound2
The
application
may
be
easier
to
maintain
but
the
system
pay
the
price
if
you
want
to
drop
some
backend
then
drop
PA
and
stick
with
ALSA
once
every
system
that
have
PA
require
ALSA
Another
good
reason
is
not
to
lose
audience
once
other
browser
is
maintain
ALSA
support
the
problem
is
most
of
them
are
not
necessarily
lightweight
And
there
is
a
plenty
of
lightweight
browser
that
do
not
even
support
multimedia
I
have
be
strong
on
my
choice
for
Firefox
but
drop
ALSA
support
is
forc
me
to
look
for
alternative
please
I
beg
you
to
reconsider
the
decision

Hey
Guys
We

Ive
view
the

page
but
I
want
to
see
if
there
is
a
better
solution
for
that
In
chrome
you
can
deploy
a
key
contain
a
CRX
location
to
install
Using
an
auto
update
file
you
can
install
the
whole
extension
This
method
is
trust
due
to
the
reason
that
the
person
that
is
able
to
deploy
it
is
only
the
IT
administrator
I
there
any
way
similar
to
that
I
can
use
If
not
is
the
only
simple
way
is
by
drop
the

Firefox
zoom
work

without
3rd

I
dont
know
if
it
has
been
in
other
version
this
year
but
it
has
happen
in
the
past
on
different
system
with
either
linux
or
windows7
and
10
and
different
owner
Basically
there
is
an
update
and
then
zoom
dont
work
which
is
very
strange
as
zoom
is
a
buildin
function
since
Firefox
version
3
then
there
is
a
new
update
and
zoom
work
again
then
a
new
update
and
zoom
dont
work
again
and
it
continue
I
think
you
need
to
look
at
what
is
happen
and
why
this
happen
and
then
issue
an
update
Kinda
stupid
that
buildin
function
get
disable
every
second
update
I
know
I
can
install
an
addon
which
give
me
the
feature
but
then
I
could
continue
do
that
everytime
someone
forget
a
function
in
the
newest
update
better
get
it
sort
out
now
In
the
meantime
I
use
Zoom
page
WEbut
it
clutter
I
could
live
without
A
page
in
the
support
section
on
how
to
disableenable
buildin
function
through
aboutconfig
would
be
nice
And
to
keep
it
update
if
major
change
are
made
You
have
some
very
old
guide
still
there
go
back
to
firefox
3
they
do
not
apply
to
firefox
55
Hope
this
will
be
fix
soon

I
try

Firefox
focus
stolen
under
Windows
10
A
while
ago
I
akse
a
question
regard
focus
be
stolen
from
Firefox
under
Windows
10
See
httpssupportmozillaorgenUSquestions1154862
Its
taken
me
a
long
time
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
this
but
I
think
Ive
finally
figure
it
out
What
happen
is
that
if
you
launch
Firefox
soon
after
initially
log
into
Windows
10
something
steal
focus
often
while
the
user
is
in
the
middle
of
typ
something
At
first
I
thought
this
problem
only
happen
with
Firefox
However
I
subsequently
discover
it
also
happen
with
other
tasksapplication
launch
soon
after
log
in
to
Windows
The
problem
is
relate
to
background
task
that
run
automatically
as
part
of
Windows
10
start
up
If
any
task
in
the
Startup
list
in
Task
Manager
request
focus
it
appear
that
Windows
10
allocate
focus
to
that
task
irrespective
of
whether
or
not
the
user
has
launch
another
application
in
the
foreground
that
currently
has
focus
In
my
case
the
offend
start
up
task
were
AiChargerPlus
and
Sandboxie
Control
The
result
is
very
annoy
A
far
as
I
can
tell
the
only
workaround
are
1
Wait
for
all
start
up
task
to
complete
before
launch
any
application
2
Disable
all
task
in
the
start
up
list
that
take
focus
This
may
not
be
possible
the
start
up
task
are
essential
I
there
a
better
solution
Why
can
log
file
not
be
open
directly
in
the
browser
On
Linux
Debian
8
with
Firefox
55
when
I
try
to
open
a
link
to
a
log
file
firefox
only
allow
me
to
open
the
file
with
an
external
viewer
The
open
dialog
state
that
the
file
build16015log
is
of
type
application
log
I
can
choose
to
open
the
file
with
GVim
or
to
save
it
A
this
file
is
plain
text
I
would
like
to
open
in
directly
in
firefox
so
that
I
can
use
the
refresh
button
to
easily
see
update
content
I
can
see
that
the
mime
type
definition
with
comment
application
log
is
in
usrsharemimetextxlogxml
This
file
has
codemimetype
type=textxlogcode
and
also
contain
codesubclassof
type=textplaincode
and
codeglob
pattern=logcode
When
I
download
the
file
and
run
the
command
file
mimetype
b
build16015log
it
return
textplain
Why
do
firefox
not
recognize
this
file
as
a
plain
text
file
and
is
there
any
way
to
override
this
Also
while
troubleshoote
I
install
the
Open
at
Text
extension
however
that
extension
still
do
not
allow
me
to
view
the
file
in
the
browser
Firefox
window
doesnt
allow
other
open
document
to
override
it
display
With
multiple
document
and
Firefox
open
on
desktop
other
document
wont
display
over
Firefox
I
have
to
minimize
Firefox
to
look
at
other
document

Changing
state
of
thirdparty
compositor
appear
to
crash
tab
render
engine
So
Im
use
Firefox
55021
on
Linux
and
Ive
notice
an
issue
that
occur
I
dont
recall
it
ever
happen
in
previous
version
Im
use
a
thirdparty
compositor
and
chang
it
state
appear
to
crash
gecko
You
can
observe
what
I
mean
at
httpsvimeocom231154755
For
anyone
who
watch
that
video
and
believe
that
killall
compton
isnt
a
suitable
way
to
stop
compton
there
isnt
really
a
way
to
stop
it
Its
design
to
be
a
daemon
it
just
pipe
flag
to
the
daemon
So
even
compton
CG
which
supposedly
stop
shadow
and
transparency
composite
cause
the
open
tab
to
fail
Granted
you
could
argue
that
this
isnt
Firefoxs
fault
but
at
the
same
time
Chromium
and
other
browser
dont
crash
when
the
state
of
the
compositor
change
A
I
said
this
didnt
happen
in
previous
version
so
Im
wonder
if
there
was
some
update
to
Firefox
that
cause
this
to
happen
I
there
any
debug
outputlog
I
could
check
out
I
know
this
issue
may
appear
quite
nongeneric
in
the
sense
that
my
system
is
quite
heavily
customise
so
a
fix
might
not
be
possible
if
it
cannot
be
recreate
on
a
dev
machine
so
I
was
wonder
if
you
guy
know
any
official
bug
report
platform
for
Firefox
beyond
this
forum
or
if
similar
issue
have
been
report
recently
why
cant
I
access
ebay
The
follow
appear
you
dont
have
permission
to

How
to
restore
page
cach
behavior
after
upgrade
from
450
I
have
been
use
Firefox
v450
for
quite
a
long
time
and
decid
to
try
out
a
newer
version
recently
Currently
I
have
upgrad
to
a
slightly
old
version
Nightly
550a1
20170524
64bit
After
the
transition
I
notice
that
some
of
the
page
that
were
be
cach
in
memory
by
default
were
no
longer
get
cach
For
example
I
am
use
the
mobile
Gmail
site
httpsmailgooglecommailu0xa
where
the
page
open
during
the
current
FF
session
remain
in
cach
possibly
only
inmemory
until
FF
is
shut
down
so
that
I
can
simply
place
FF
in
offline
mode
and
browse
through
the
Gmail
page
I
had
open
during
that
session
by
click
through
the
browser
history
However
in
the
latest
version
I
get
an
offline
mode
error
when
do
this
Even
if
I
simply
open
httpsmailgooglecommailu0xa
place
the
browser
in
offline
mode
right
after
that
without
close
the
tab
and
refresh
the
tab
I
get
the
offline
mode
error
mean
that
absolutely
no
attempt
is
made
by
the
browser
to
cache
the
page
content
in
memory
I
also
try
the
570a1
Nightly
from
08242017
3
day
ago
and
observe
the
same
behaviour
Also
it
seem
that
there
are
other
site
affect
by
the
same
behaviour
eg
Google
Docs
https0facebookcomhomephp
which
is
also
a
mobile
site
while
cach
is
work
perfectly
for
other
site
eg
this
Mozilla
Support
site
Firefox
Addons
site
httpsaddonsmozillaorg
Google
Search
StackExchange
site
range
StackOverflow
etc
I
would
like
to
know
if
there
is
a
way
to
restore
the
old
behaviour
of
cach
all
open
page
at
least
in
memory
during
the
browser
runtime
At
the
moment
Im
unable
to
attach
any
diagnostic
information
I
am
post
this
via
Google

as

not
allow
me

an
account
during
the

processit
simply

message
as

However

can
provide
any
require
information
once
I

I
have
been
use
firefox
forever
include
very
successfully
on
a
2014
Macbook
pro
with
update
version
of
Sierra
I
just
got
a
2017
Macbook
pro
with
the
same
OS
and
firefox
wont
load
certain
webpage
until
I
close

it
Any

what
might
be
go
on
and
how
to
remedy
Firefox
is
not
display
my
website
price
correctly
work
on
other
browser
So
our
company
website
is
selininycom
Our
price
on
Firefox
do
not
alway
show
up
correctly
but
in
chrome
edge
they
display
just
fine
Our
programmer
who
handl
this
code
unexpectedly
left
our
company
Im
not
a
programmer
myself
although
I
can
usually
stumble
my
way
into
a
solution
but
this
has
me
stump
Im
pretty
sure
it
has
to
do
with
the
small
bit
of
java
that
we
use
to
divide
the
price
by
how
many
piece
or
pair
are
in
each
item
so
that
we
show
our
customer
the
unit
price
ex
a
12pc
Bow
Tie
set
=
12so
the
unit
price
show
in
1
per
unit
The
weird
thing
is
if
you
refresh
the
page
a
few
time
it
may
display
the
correct
unit
price
and
viceversa
if
it
show
the
incorrect
price
refresh
the
page
sometime
make
the
price
read
correctly
Also
when
the
price
is
display
incorrectly
the
item
name
has
the
word
Original
text
ad
to
the
end
of
the
product
name
This
issue
only
affect
item
price
which
are
be
divide
to
show
the
unit
price
which
make
me
think
it
that
bit
of
java
that
i
mention
above
An
example
item
that
has
this
issue
is
httpsselininycomties6pcprepackdiamondtipbandedbowtiedbb303027
the
above
product
should
be
display
a
price
of
250
per
unit
6
unit
per
pack
for
a
total
price
of
1500
for
me
now
it
is
display
023
per
unit
66
unit
per
pack
for
a
total
of
1500
After
I
refresh
this
page
a
few
time
the
price
and
unit
per
pack
show
the
correct
price
now
I
will
attach
photo
of
each
scenario
for
better
understand
I
dont
even
know
if
this
is
the
correct
place
to
ask
for
help
so
any
and
all
information
would
be
greatly
appreciate

I
dont

if
this
has
happen
to
any
other
FirefoxReddit
user
but
in
the
last
24
hour
a
number
of
feature
on

have
stop
work
for
me
namely
click
the

for
My

do
nothing
the

that
Im
subscribe

doesnt
appear
similarly
click
the

to
expand
a

rather
than
open
it
in
another
tab
text
post
videoimageGIF
also
do
nothing
Constantly
click
it
over
and
over
just
make
Firefox
act
like
Im
doubleclick
to
select
something
This
is
also
true
for
try

saveeditsharedelete
a
post
speak
of
open
stuff
in
separate
tab
It
just
doesnt
do
that
anymore
Ive
even
doublecheck
my
preference
within
Reddit
and
it
do
say
to
open
link
in
a
new
windowtab
but
it
just
load
it
within
the
same
one
despite
that
For
the
record
Ive
test
the
site
out
in
another
browser
both
Safari
and
Chrome
on
the
offchance
that
idunno
someone
at
Reddit
change
something
about
the
site
and
screw
up
the
whole
thing
Reddit
work
finea
expect
in
both
Safari
and
Chrome
as
well
as
use
other
site
that
have
similar
feature
because
while
Im
no
computer
wizard
Im
guess
it
a
JavaScript
thing
and
there
was
no
problem
there
so
I
can
only
assume
it
a
Redditspecific
issue
and
on
the
subject
of
JavaScript
it
is
enable
in
my
aboutconfig
set
Ive
not
even
touch

also
Ive
crosspost

Will

Id

Seeing
as
Mozilla
is
teame
up
with
group
like
Online
News
Association
I
can
assume
it
will
only
be
a
matter
of
time
se
as
member
of
that
group
have
held
less
than
favorable
view
toward
conservative

conservative
media
Like
when
their

manager

about

we
need

take
action
and
Resist
the
TrumpGOP
agenda
on
Feb
22
and
she
recently
tweet
say
she
want
an
all
female
reboot
of

Or
their
vice

Mandy
Jenkins
who
has
made
several

say
that
there
need
to
be
fewer

in

and
fewer
male

What
about

David

who
said

The
GOP
I
Violating

on

17
or
when

call
the

No
matter
how
you
read
into
this
thing
are
NOT
look
good
for
unbiase
even
hand
censorship
of

new
So
the
question
Ill
ask
again
is

I

or
do
you
think
Mozilla
is
go
to
get
their
shit
together

I
went
to
the
Mozilla
site
link
but
couldnt
find
anything
tel
how
to
fix
this
I
want
to
prevent
tab
from
tear
off
into
a
new
window
I
recently
had
to
refresh
FF
so
I
lost
all
my
extension
I
had
one
extension
call
bug489729
Disable
detach
and
tear
off
tab
httpsaddonsmozillaorgenUSfirefoxaddonbug489729disabledetachandt
This
was
in
my
opinion
the
most
vital
extension
I
had
but
now
since
refresh
it
look
like
it
has
been
remove
by
the
user
The
strange
thing
is
the
function
that
that
extension
provide
was
work
just
fine
right
before
I
refresh
my
FF
despite
the
extension
have
been
delete
Anyways
I
know
someone
out
there
must
know
how
to
prevent
that
annoy
detachingtear
tab
feature
so
my
question
is
can
someone
tell
me
a
way
to
prevent
tab
from
tear
off
into
a
new
window
It
accidentally
happen
way
way
too
often
it
much
too
easy
to
make
this
mistake
and
that
feature
is
pretty
awful
Thanks
in
advance

To

I
try

autoupdate
I
was
not
able
to

however
a
friend
was
able
to
replicate
on

machine
and
confirm
the
issue
doesnt
occur
in
Chrome
or
IE
on
the
same
box
Both
of
us
agree
it
was
work
fine
a
week

Looking
to
confirm
the
issue
KAM
Firefox
cant
see
sync
tab
from
iPad
Tried
out
Firefox
sync
for
the
first
time
Almost
everything
work
well
except
I
cant
view
synce
tab
from
my
iPad
on
my
desktop
Firefox
on
Win10
But
I
can
view
tab
from
my
desktop
on
my
iPad
Firefox
How
do
I
fix
this
game
wont
scrol
right
page
keep
move
even
if
not
click
mouse
I
stop
use
FF
because
it
had
to
many
problem
then
heard
you
guy
made
a
better
version
so
reinstall
it
and
it
work
great
for
about
30
min
then
all
of
a
sudden
it
start
not
let
me
scroll
across
game
page
every
time
I
try
to
move
across
page
it
take
me
right
back
to
ware
I
was
even
if
not
click
mouse
to
move
it
even
if
just
try
to
move
courser
across
the
page
this
is
annoy
and
frustrate
as
all
hell
It
work
fine
to
start
with
why
is
it
do
this
and
can
it
be
fix
Why
do
firefox
hang
when
compose
message
and
copy
and
past
into
the
compose
window
for
httpsoutlookoffice365com
When
compose
some
message
on
httpsoutlookoffice365com
the
compose
window
slow
to
the
point
where
it
hang
and
wont
accept
any
input
This
didnt
happen
in
Chrome
or
IE
so
I
think
the
way
it
work
must
hit
on
some
weird
part
of
the
Firefox
browser
Has
anyone
else
experience
this
or
have
any
advice
It
seem
pretty
bad
if
a
popular
webmail
service
become
unusable
on
a
regular
basis

and
much
love

white
in
some
mode
I
have
try
allow
popup
in
gmail
set
Safe
Mode
F8
I
have
disable
addon
I
have
almost
none
I
can
attach
file
in
Chrome
just
fine
I
can
drag
and
drop
a
file
into
a
gmail
but
that
extra
step
and
a
hassle
When
I
click
the
attach
button
it
highlight
properly
but
nothing
open
up
No
file
to
select
Please
help
How
di

move
all
bookmark
from

about
10
day

has
not

You

And
i

If

so
that
the
plus

put
my
mouse
all
the
way
in
the
very
top
left
corner
of
the
screen
Now
since
this

the
very
very
top
left

has
now
stop

that

do
still
function
but
I
have
to
move
my
mouse
down
or
to
the
right
slightly
to
get
it
to
work
Im
sure
this
was
not
an
intend
purpose
for
the
tab
button
so
please
let
me
know
when
you
guy
fix
it
or
if
there
is
a
temporary
fix
that
I
can
implement
on

Clear
cache
and
addon
issue
Hey
Guys
gal
I
have
a
questionissue
and
need
some
information
I
have
an
addon
I
have
had
for
a
long
time
but
have
recently
start
have
a
problem
with
it
that
I
think
is
cause
by
Firefox
When
I
use
Firefox
with
private
window
and
after
i
am
done
I
clear
your
recent
history
it
somehow
keep
default
the
addin
in
firefox
The
addon
use
a
port
to
talk
to
program
and
the
port
can
be
set
to
any
port
Lets
say
i
set
addon
to
use
port
4000
as
soon
as
I
clear
all
recent
history
the
addon
stop
work
I
then
have
to
open
addon
window
in
firefox
and
reset
the
port
back
to
4000
So
is
this
issue
a
Firefox
issue
or
is
it
an
addon
issue
It
only
happen
when
I
clear
your
recent
history
function
in
firefox
I
dont
alway
catch
the
issue
and
lose
some
data
I
thought
was
mak
it
to
the
program
but
stop
as
the
port
got
change
back
to
80
Thanks
in
advance

has
been
have
an
issue
with
my
new
computer
Windows
10
Home
64
bit
where
I
close
it
but
it
still
active
in
the
Task
Manager
forc
me
to
shut
it
down
through
the
TM
and
have
to
use
session
restore
a
fair
amount
of
the
time
when
I
open
FF
again
This
I
eventually
thought
I
figure
out
was
due
to
tax
my
memory
mostly
heavy
youtube
use
it
seem
that
this
occur
whenever
I
had
an
active
video
or
when
I
had
been
play
many
video
and
the
memory
use
start
to
shoot
up
This
seem
to
do
the
trick
as
far
as
use
TM
to
close
the
browser
too
often
though
I
still
use
it
more
than
I
ever
did
before
for
FF
This
was
until
last
month
when
I
had
to
kill
the
process
due
to
a
pop
up
window
that
wouldnt
go
away
and
now
every
time
the
browser
crash
or
I
have
to
go
through
task
manager
Firefox
lose
my
data
Ill
reopen
FF
and
itll
come
back
to
a
single
tab
on
my
home
page
and
when
I
try
to
restore
the
previous
session
through
recently
close
window
itll
open
it
for
a
moment
and
then
crash
lose
everything
I
had
and
forc
me
to
go
through
aboutsupport
and
use
the
sessionstore
file
The
issue
aside
from
the
pain
in
the
ass
it
is
to
go
through
the
file
each
time
is
that
sessionstore
file
are
alway
day
behind
essentially
erase
anything
Ive
done
in
the
previous
3672
hour
There
are
no
viruse
or
malware
on
my
computer
I
also
have
no
extension
that
I
didnt
have
on
my
previous
computer
and
this
never
occur
before
Ive
delete
cooky
remove
a
couple
of
extension
that
I
no
longer
use
and
it
still
not
help
Ive
yet
to
lose
any
important
data
but
Im
on
the
verge
of
give
up
on
FF
it
slow
and
with
these
problem
I
cant
see
a
reason
of
stick
around
when
Im
constantly
play

my

determine
that
the

is
the

and
it

I
stop

Looking
for
new
laptop
I
use
lot
of
tab
which
processor
etc
I
am
look
for
new
laptop
and
most
important
to
me
is
to
be
able
to
browse
Firefox
with
lot
of
tab
open
and
have
it
run
smoothly
as
possible
I
understand
that
a
few
piece
of
hardware
are
important
when
try
to
browse
in
Firefox
with
lot
of
tab
But
I
can
not
find
any
definite
answer
to
my
situation
because
everybody
has
different
variable
I
have
been
try
to
figure
out
for
my
need
at
what
point
will
even
better
more
expensive
processor
andor
amount
of
ram
no
longer
make
a
difference
in
performance
of
Firefox
with
approximately
50+
tab
open
I
dont
go
that
many
often
but
when
I
do
I
dont
want
Firefox
effect
Now
with
Firefox
64
bit
more
core
in
the
processor
could
help
along
with
enough
ram
So
in
my
situation
while
assume
I
have
no
other
program
run
only
Firefox
I
have
an
adblocker
addon
install
I
have
MultiProcess
Windows
enable
and
money
is
not
a
factor
just
waste
of
money
matter
would
an
i7
over
an
i5
be
any
better
would
a
quad
core
over
a
dual
core
be
any
better
would
an
SSD
with
512GB
make
any
difference
over
SSD
256GB
would
16gb
over
12gb
be
any
better
and
is
there
anything
else

I

that

a

with

Unfortunately
Microsoft
has
misconfigure
a

OCSP
staple
on
their

which
got
now
cach
in

In

enter

confirm
the

it

up

search
for
the

Doubleclick
it
and
change
it

this
will
degrade
a

please
revisit
it
in

Why
Firefox
made
it
impossible
to
have
a
local
htmlfile
in
new
tab
Actually
it
cant
be
solve
Firefox
broke
this
possibility
long
time
ago
They
told
us
use
an
addon
New
tab
override
Its
an
ungly
solution
to
have
an
addon
just
for
this
purpose
but
for
some
time
it
work
But
now
Firefox
broke
it
again
Newtaboverride
offer
to
import
my
local
file
but
it
cant
display
it
the
same
way
as
it
was
before
I
think
I
need
to
install
a
webserver
on
my
machine
just
to
have
a
local
file
in
new
tab
How
awesome
is
this
Besides
this
newtaboverride
has
a
big
problem
with
locationbar
If
I
open
new
tab
then
there
is
still
the
text
of
the
location
of
newtaboverride
I
cant
just
start
typ
a
new
url
I
need
to
select
all
and
delete
first
It
work
in
Firefox
54
but
guess
what
Firefox
broke
this
too
How
can
I
go
back
to
Firefox
3
or
something
To
the
good
old
time
where
nothing
was
broken

How
to
override
Firefox
behavior
of
block
access
to
site
with
incorrect
HTTPS
set
I
frequently
have
problem
of
access
site
with
incorrect
HTTPS
set
fresh
example
httpswwwslidesharenet
Question
how
do
I
override
the
Firefox
habit
of
mandatory
block
such
site
Place
whichever
warn
etc
but
leave
possibility
to
see
the
content
on
my
own
risk
After
all
Firefox
just
a
tool
I
do
not
wish
it
to
make
decision
on
my
behalf
Nor
do
I
grant
such
power
to
Mozilla
So
far
I
use
lowlevel
mean
to
access
such
problem
resource
such
as
download
them
with
wget
or
similar
tool
But
I
refer
to
do
that
in
browser
y
spam
the
menu
bar
with
any
amount
of
warn
etc
just
give
me
possibility
to
override
the
above
behaviour

Cant

I
understand
from
search
the
web
this
is
a
problem
of
font
color
When
try
to
enter
a
note
the

is
invisible
and
any
text
you
enter
is
invisible
It
show
up
if
you

Hi
This
seem
to
be
a
recent
bug
Basically
Firefox
has
stop
render
incomplete
colour
hex
code
so
the
note
text
is
written
as
0000
in
the
CSS
so
Firefox
is
say
that
not
a
valid
colour
because
colour
need
6
character
So
MSFT
need
to
update
their
CSS
to
be
000000
instead
The
workaround
is
to
use
a
different
browser
sign
up
i
thought
I
sign
up
but
when
went
to
go
in
said
wrong
pw
ask
to
reset
never
came
try
sign
in
blah
blah
I
need
to
know
if
I
have

and
after
this
succeed
I
had
the
problem
that
Firefox
didnt
believe
me
that
I

so
I
had
to

I
did
After

which
is

itself
When
I
create
a

and
add
this
to
my
Firefox

I
get
back
all
the

But
this
cant
be
the
only
solution
I
had
to
install
and
configure
all
sort
of

and
this
would
be
pretty
time
consume
just
because
the

somehow
isnt
work

that
the
image
need
to
change
it
swap
the
SVG
But
during
the
describe
condition
where
a
different
tab
is
select
and
one
return
to
the
tab
of
the
web
page
the
SVG
will
not
be
load
To
solve
this
I
have
attempt
to
make
it
call
the
function
that
set
the
SVG
when
the
page
regain
focus
This
has
not
solve
the
problem
only
heavily
decrease
the
chance
of
it
What
I
have
experience
since
then
is
that
since
the
SVG
will
reload
every
time
the
window
regain
focus
if
I
continually
hide
and
unhide
the
window
therefore
cause
it
to
reload
the
SVG
eventually
the
SVG
will
simply
not
load
and
be
invisible
I
can
hide
and
unide
the
window
again
and
it
will
likely
reload
For
each
time
it
is
reload
there
is
a
small
chance
it
will
simply
not
show
I
have
been
experience
this
even
when
not
attempt
to
reproduce
it
This
can
also
be
done
in
a
timely
manner
by
click
the
SVG
then
click
the
background
to
the
side
This
will
also
cause
it
to
refresh
and
is
a
much
faster
method
Notes
1
I
am
refresh
it
continually
simply
to
cause
the
issue
I
have
been
experience
regardless
to
occur
If
I
do
not
do
this
it
will
happen
eventually
anyway
be
it
when
the
SVG
is
change
each
minute
or
when
the
tab
is
switch
to
2
It
is
possible
that
the
code
for
my
website
is
at
fault
I
acknowledge
this
possibility
Though
I
have
not
been
able
to
reproduce
the

issue
on

which
lead
me
to
believe
this
is

I

in

if
it
is
associate
with

any

which
cause

Stepping

if
I
want
to

process
Understand
I
am
not

or
look
for
an
immediate

I
know
I
am
run
a

and
from
time
to
time
there
will
be
bug
Rather
I
am
attempt
to
report
this
so
that

can
address
it

I
am

My
behavior
So
that
you
will
know
how
I
am
use
FF
when
the
problem
occur
First
I
Open
a
PUBLIC
window
this
is
for
one
of
my
streame
service
which
will
not
operate
in
private
mode
Second
I
Open
a
PRIVATE
window
via
FileNew
Private
Window
as
my
primary
work
window
Then
I
start
streame
Live
TV
in
the
public
window
throw
it
up
on
Screen
two
I
then
have
the
private
window
to
work
in
Opening
my
primary
Email
and
pin
the
tab
Using
another
tab
I
will
begin
search
topics
sometime
link
from
a
trust
Email
I
often
find
myself
with
5
or
6
tab
open
on
different
topics
Of
course
I
end
up
with
nonbrowser
app
like
Excel
and
Word
Acrobat
open
All
of
this
is
typical
for
me
and
not
normally
a
problem
However
a
short
while
ago
along
with
3
or
4
previous
occurrence
over
the
last
week
or
two
Suddenly
the
streame
TV
will
start
shudder
and
freeze
and
response
time
to
even
my
mouse
will
die
this
is
when
the
not
respond
error
will
appear
if
I
am
in
or
switch
to
FF
Upon
open
the
Resource
Monitor
I
find

Disk
IO
approach
MBsec
Physical
Memory
FULL
and
Hard
Faultssec
run
in

Typically
In
recover
I
can
either
kill
the
Firefox
thread
or
if
Im
patient
shut
FF
down
properly
However
if
I
let
it
go
on
long
enough
the
system
get
slower
slower
until
it
stop
require
a

cold
start
I
hope
this
is
helpful

Isnt
Gecko
SDK
4102
compatible
with

53
and
later
Hi
all
Im
work
on
the
Gecko
SDK
in
C++
I
try
to
call
the
function
NS_GetServiceManager
to
get
the
service
manager
from
xullib
provide
by
the
SDK
41
When
I
run
my
app
in
FF
53
or
later
I
got
the
error
message
please
see
attach
file
error
messagepng
The
issue
do
not
happen
when
I
run
my
app
in
FF
52
or
earlier
I
use
Dependence
Walker
to
check
the
exist
function
in
the
dll
xuldll
provide
by
the
SDK
41
and
xuldll
in
FF
53
I
saw
that
there
is
no
function
NS_GetServiceManager
in
xuldll
53
but
xuldll
41
=
I
think
this
is
the
root
cause
of
the
error
message
Comparing
them
I
saw
that
there
are
many
difference
between
them
please
see
attach
file
xuldll
funtionspng
In
the
Get
the
SDK
section
at
httpsdevelopermozillaorgenUSdocsMozillaGeckoGecko_SDK
look
like
latest
Gecko
is
compatible
with
latest
FF
please
see
attach
file
Gecko
SDKpng
Click
on
Download
link
I
see
the
latest
version
of
the
SDK
is
4102
So
is
Gecko
SDK
4102
really
compatible
with
FF
53
and
later
If
y
how
can
I
call
the
function
NS_GetServiceManager
to
get
the
service
manager
in
FF
53
or
later
If
no
when
is
the
new
SDK
release
that
is
really
compatible
with
latest
FF
Thanks

there
anyway
to

keep
the
rest
of
my

in

If
not
can
this
be

so
that
on

page
the

is
a

I
am
horrify
to
find
all
my
credit
card
detail
after
an
online
purchase
held
in
recoveryj
or
sessionstorej
How
is
this
secure
I
was
attempt
to
restore
my
tab
and
as
it
wasnt
work
properly
I
was
edite
a
sessionstorej
or
recoveryj
look
for
URL
that
were
present
so
I
could
reopen
the
tab
to
recreate
what
I
had
before
To
my
horror
on
one
of
the
tab
detail
I
find
stor
in
the
sessionstorerecovery
all
the
detail
from
a
purchase
page
I
had
fill
in
to
buy
a
tour
had
not
only
my
name
and
address
but
telephone
number
and
address
That
would
be
bad
enough
but
also
stor
was
the
complete
detail
of
my
credit
card
which
I
had
use
for
the
purchase
That
include
the
name
on
the
credit
card
expiry
date
and
security
code
It
probably
also
had
the
card
number
but
I
had
been
do
some
edite
so
may
have
accidentally
delete
it
before
I
notice
what
was
in
there
How
is
this
a
regard
by
Mozilla
for
my
privacy
and
security
When
will
this
be
rectify
I
hope
soon
as
this
sort
of
information
should
not
be
left
aroundstor
on
a
computer
follow
it
use
I
am
not
go
to
share
the
file
detail
with
you
for
obvious
reason
so
I
am
not
sure
if
the
attach
information
will
be
any
use
to
you

Hello
Love
Firefox
Thank
you
for
the
work
I
appear
to
be
have
issue
with
5503
on
my
system
I
have
a
Dell
Inspiron
laptop
AMD
FX9800P
Radeon
R7
w
16GB
RAM
I
am
run
Windows
10
x64
1506368
I
am
on
a
domain
under
my
user
profile
though
I
am
a
domain
admin
under
another
profile
About
the
only
thing
clever
we
are
run
is
redirect
folder
include
AppData
Roaming
in
case
that
is
relevant
Symptoms
include
a
blank
bookmark
toolbar
blank
sidebar
blank
Show
All
Bookmarks
popup
inability
to
restore
backup
file
unable
to
process
backup
file
inability
to
import
from
html
I
can
select
the
html
file
but
then
nothing
actually
show
up
I
have
had
up
to
4
extension
install
but
I
have
problem
in
safe
mode
as
well
The
extension
were
uBlock
Origin
LastPass
Privacy
Badger
HTTPS
Everywhere
I
have
try
uninstal
and
reinstal
several
time
with
and
without
addon
Sometimes
on
reinstall
my
addon
have
been
present
even
though
I
uninstall
restart
reinstall
without
my
reinstal
the
addon
I
have
remove
all
addon
of
course
in
further
test
I
have
try
in
safe
mode
I
have
refresh
Firefox
use
the
Refresh
tool
No
issue
from
Chrome
or
Edge
I
have
read
article
like
the
follow
and
attempt
to
follow
the
instruction
with
no
luck
httpssupportmozillaorgenUSkbrecoverlostormissingbookmarksw_mybookmarkshavedisappeared
The
other
symptom
I
note
is
that
Firefox
is
very
slow
sometime
with
an
individual
page
hang
at
load
time
for
what
seem
to
be
510
second
with
the
little
blue
circle
apparently
frozen
It
then
load
the
page
This
behavior
is
not
observe
in
other
browser
Interestingly
my
Domain
Admin
profile
also
a
member
of
the
local
administrator
group
on
this
workstation
do
not
appear
to
experience
problem
with
hang
or
bookmark
issue
addon
are
still
present
after
uninstall
restart
reinstall
unless
I
specifically
remove
them
prior
to
uninstall
The
only
difference
I
can
detect
is
that
it
has
local
and
domain
admin
privilege
and
it
do
not
use
redirect
folder
Last
little
note
When
I
download
file
they
do
not
appear
to
go
into
my
user
download
folder
they
are
visible
in
the
download
arrow
in
Firefox
but
click
on
show
contain
folder
do
not
bring
up
Windows
File
Explorer
and
manually
open
up
Windows
File
Explorer
and
go
to
Downloads
do
not
show
the
file
even
though
they
appear
to
have
download
eg
I
download
a
Fedora
iso
and
it
took
about
510
minute
and
show
the
download
progress
and
looke
like
it
finish
but
I
cant
find
the
iso
when
search
my
entire
system
I
was
able
to
work
around
this
issue
by
select
the
option
to
Always
ask
you
where
to
save
file
and
select
a
different
folder
on
my
C
Drive
or
map
network
drive
Any
help
would
be
greatly
appreciate
I
am
guess
there
is
an
issue
with
the
redirection
that
I
have
not
observe
in
previous
version
of
Firefox
I
there
a
download
link
for
54
Cant
move
bookmark
to
top
of
list
I
would
like
to
move
my
most
use
bookmark
to
the
top
of
the
list
When
I
drag
a
bookmark
up
and
it
get
close
to
the
top
the
insert
line
goe
away
When
I
release
the
mouse
the
bookmark
wind
up
at
the
bottom
of
the
list
I
cant
print
out
of
Firefox
I
have
Java
Scripting
turn
off
Could
this
be
the
problem
I
am
try
to
print
out
of
Firefox
Printer
send
out
a
blank
page
I
can
print
out
of
Explorer
Firefox
tab
search
sometime
cant
find
open
tab
I
have
nearly
2000
tab
open
as
a
result
of
browse
the
internet
for
a
decade
and
because
I
dont
use
bookmark
In
order
to
find
a
previously
visit
website
I
open
a
new
window
or
tab
and
search
for
the
site
by
typ
in
a
partial
name
or
address
in
the
address
bar
where
the
URL
normally
goe
This
get
me
a
list
of
match
and
I
select
the
desire
site
whereupon
the
window
or
tab
close
and
I
am
taken
to
the
tab
contain
said
site
The
problem
is
that
sometime
Firefox
cant
find
the
open
tab
Typing
in
the
title
of
the
tab
do
not
reveal
any
match
Firefox
search
simply
seem
to
lose
grasp
of
which
tab
are
open
I
can
make
it
work
again
by
manually
find
the
old
tab
open
a
new
tab
and
past
in
the
address
of
the
old
one
Firefox
can
then
find
the
tab
again
Manually
find
the
old
tab
can
be
quite
time
consume
and
is
very
annoy
I
there
any
way
to
fix
Firefox
so
that
it
can
find
open
tab
My
webpage

not

Hello
I
am
use
jQuery
UI
which
has
an
autocomplete
feature
This
feature
load
a
div
with
result
under
textbox
while
write
Now
I
need
to
inspect
the
row
of
that
div
which
is
a
problem
Hovering
effect
is
not
handl
as
hover
but
additional
class
so
I
cannot
check
show
hover
effect
on
console
Now
If
you
make
the
div
load
and
you
click
to
the
console
for
the
hover
div
you
need
the
div
hide
remove
the
additional
class
I
need
to
inspect
And
even
if
I
for
example
select
first
row
then
go
back
to
the
textbox
and
reinitialize
show
the
div
by
write
it
overwrite
so
the
select
div
disappeare
so
cannot
be
select
on
console
I
have
also
try
CTRL+SHIFT+C
while
hover
but
it
also
hide
the
autocomplete
box
so
I
cannot
inspect
the
class
I
have
also
try
to
simply
open
the
console
by
F12
but
this
will
not
select
the
row
and
also
hide
the
div
Far
back
when
Firefox
still
had
a
3D
view
feature
miss
that
very
much
by
the
way
really
help
developer
see
the
structure
of
page
I
was
also
able
to
do
that
because
the
3D
view
pause
the
page
So
i
hover
initialize
3D
view
and
tadaa
I
was
able
to
click
through
dom
in
that
pause
state
I
also
use
the
DEV
version
of
FF
so
I
am
not
able
to
try
TILT
addon
if
it
can
do
this
So
any
solution
how
to
puse
the
render
page
to
be
able
go
through
the
actual
state
in
console
of
course
I
did
it
like
I
remember
the
class
and
write
it
to
row
of
hidden
not
yet
remove
div
but
this
can
not
be
the
right
solution
I
look
for

SessionManager
and
Plugins
partially
reset
after
crash
Maybe
it
just
a
coincidence
with
an
upgrade
but
here
my
scenario
i
am
run
firefox
with
many
tab
open
over
900
and
after
a
while
run
it
start
to
consume
much
CPURAM
until
I
have
to
kill
it
A
restart
will
return
almost
instantaneously
to
this
laggyunfunctional
state
After
reboot
this
problem
is
resolve
i
use
the
excellent
plugin
SessionManager
to
organize
and
restore
my
session
Today
I
run
into
this
problem
again
after
12
crash
firefox
first
fail
to
bring
back
my
tab
show
notification
of
some
pinn
tab
so
despite
stay
in
blank
state
no
tab
appear
After
the
next
restart
firefox
restart
without
ask
me
for
my
last
session
It
start
with
all
plugin
disable
tag
as
legacy
so
I
am
assume
this
is
the
effect
of
an
upgrade
but
also
lost
all
my
session
Not
completely
lost
both
of
my
session
group
are
still
shown
in
the
Session
Manager
but
they
are
just
contain
1
session
each
without
any
tab
There
should
be
restore
session
from
my
last
10
day
but
they
are
gone

underneath
Word
Paint
ect
can
not
log
in

site
is
the
reason
but
it
is
secure
I
have
receive
an
email
with
picture
of
a
family
wed
but
it
come
up
the
insecure
site
I
would
like
to
open
it
Lightbeam
LIST
button
disappear
I
have
a
student
who
cannot
complete
a
Lightbeam
assignment
because
on
three
different
computer
Mac
and
two
PC
Lightbeam
do
not
provide
the
LIST
button
on
the
graphic
screen
Only
the
GRAPH
button
show
up
under
VISUALIZATION
I
was
try
to
get
into
the
developer
view
and
manage
to
change
the
BUTTON
command
from
button
class
=
list
unimplement
to
button
class
=
active
list
in
the
XML
code
Then
the
LIST
button
show
up
but
doesnt
work
So
now
MY
button
doesnt
show
up
any
more
I
have
a
Windows
10
developer
update
laptop
and
am
use
firefox
5503
32
bit
Firefox
has
the
bottom
part
of
the
taskbar
visible
when
on
fullscreen
A
the
title
say
when
on
Fullscreen
the
bottom
part
of
the
taskbar
is
visible
and
I
can
even
click
on
to
it
to
make
the
taskbar
appear
on
top
of
firefox
Clicking
anywhere
on
firefox
make
it
disappear
again
but
still
leave
that
thin
strip
of
the
taskbar
visible
I
have
check
different
browser
include
Chrome
and
Cyberfox
and
this
issue
exist
only
on
Firefox
and
Cyberfox
since
they
are
essentially
the
same
In
any
case
Firefox
is
my
main
browser
and
this
is
what
I
am
interest
in
fix
After
some
dig
I
found
out
that
if
I
lower
my
DPI
set
this
issue
goe
away
At
all
DPI
set
from
100
to
125
there
is
no
issue
But
at
130
which
is
my
prefer
set
the
blue
line
of
the
taskbar
appear
I
have
change
the
color
of
the
theme
to
change
taskbar
color
and
the
thin
line
also
change
color
I
try
hide
the
taskbar
use
Windows
autohide
taskbar
feature
and
in
this
case
I
see
the
top
of
the
taskbar
as
oppose
to
the
bottom
Again
this
is
a
Firefox
only
issue
Cyberfox
is
still
a
modify
Firefox
all
other
browser
Chrome
IE
etc
are
fine
I
am
interest
in
any
solution
that
might
work
The
reason
that
this
visible
persistent
thin
line
be
annoy
is
that
it
appear
on
fullscreen
youtube
video
as
well
as
all
fullscreen
video
and
it
most
noticeable
on
dark
video
or
video
with
black
bar
on
the
bottom
and
top
Thanks
in
advance
PS
You
have
to
view
the
attach
image
in
fullscreen
to
notice
the
blue
line
at
the
bottom
Its
very
thin
so
either
fullscreen
or
zoom
in
How
do
I
get
my
indexhtml
flash
directory
to
load
the
next
page
when
I
click
in
it
menu
So
I
have
a
flash
game
that
open
in
the
browser
with
a
indexhtml
file
and
when
I
open
it
in
the
browser
it
appear
to
work
fine
until
I
click
on
start
and
it
do
nothing
I
try
open
individual
swf
file
in
the
subfolder
and
they
work
just
fine
The
issue
is
I
cant
seem
to
get
the
game
to
load
the
file
through
it
menu
like
it
suppose
to
I
know
this
isnt
just
because
of
Firefox
because
I
try
it
in
Chrome
and
am
have
the
same
result
so
I
assume
it
something
relate
to
my
Flash
set
I
just
cant
seem
to
figure
out
what
exactly
I
use
one
FF
Window
per
screen
on
4
screen
Whenever
I
close
and
reopen
FF
the
screen
open
in
some
random
order
How
can
I
get
them
to
open
in
order
I
would
like
it
to
open
starte
on
screen
1
then
2
3
and
4
in
that
order
and
the
reason
is
so
in
the
taskbar
theyre
in
order
of
the
screen
It
just
make
so
much
more
sense
and
I
can
quickly
bring
THAT
window
to
the
front
without
bring
other
instance
in
front
of
work
Im
do
because
the
order
of
the
window
doesnt
correspond
to
the
screen
theyre
on
and
I
have
to
keep
click
until
I
get
THE
ONE
I
want
to
access
I
dont
know
why
this
doesnt
happen
automatically
it
would
make
so
much
more
sense
I
can
reorder
them
in
the
taskbar
but
it
kind
of
redundant
to
have
to
do
this
everytime
I
start
firefox
and
to
my
mind
there
really
must
be
a
way
to
do
this
it
such
a
simple
thing
and
Ive
seen
software
that
do
all
manner
of
little
tweak
to
window
and
FF
so
it
just
seem
like
there
must
be
a
way
to
tweak
this
Thanks
Maybe
someone
heard
of
an
add
on
that
keep
track
of
the
order
of
the
window
Something
like
Actual
Window
Manager
but
for
Firefox
AWM
is
an
incredibly
useful
program
for
multi
screen
setup
AWM
doesnt
work
in
this
instance
because
there
no
way
for
it
to
differentiate
the
window
from
each
other

a
while

if

I
recently
ask
a
question
about
inability
to
open
html
file
in
Outlook
I
receive
a
very
nice
reply
from
jscher2000
However
none
of
the
link
in
the
email
work
since
I
could
not
open
them
I
manage
to
manually
type
the
link
to
the
FF
website
to
convert
32
bit
to
64
bit
but
when
it
came
to
the
part
about
uninstal
the
32
bit
the
instruction
didnt
work
My
start
button
do
not
have
an
Apps
and
Features
selection
If
I
go
to
the
System
tab
there
is
not
an
app
and
feature
tab
I
try
do
a
search
for
app
on
my
computer
but
got
no
result
I
have
a
mediocre
ability
with
computer
so
I
continue
to
have
problem
I
have
even
uninstall
the
64
bit
version
of
FF
and
install
the
32
bit
version
but
I
still
have
the
same
problem
and
still
get
the
error

I
expect
I
there
a
specification
for
this
I
am
use
Firefox
Developer

version
570b3
64
bit
I
notice
that
some
website
that
I
am
develop
were
not
display
the
favicon
that
I
expect
wherea
all
other
browser
I
check
are
display
the
correct
one
I
create
a

with
these
four

in

After

with

I
discover
that
the

choose

it
see

in

When

remove

the

choose
the

I
would

to
choose

of
the
smaller

either
the
one
labell

or
the

since

are

I
would
guess
that
this
is
a
bug
since

Does
the

until
the
historycacheetc
is
clear
or
another
location
is
use
His
update
no
longer
do
the
developer
state
that
that
will
be
the
case
with
all
WebExtensions
If
this
is
true
the
decision
make
no
sense
to
me
it
basically
make
that
addon
and
potentially
all
new
addon
far
too
cumbersome
to
use
With
Firefox
56
the
rightclick
Save
A
and
ControlP
print
to
file
both
still
perfectly
retain
the
last
save
location
just
as
it
has
forever
Again
until
the
historycacheetc
is
clear
another
Save
location
is
use
or
the
browser
is
close
So
I
have
two
question
about
this
1
Are
WebExtensions
incapable
of
pass
this
data
to
the
addon
2
Will
Mozilla
remove
this
standard
part
of
the
Firefox
Save
A
dialog
in
a
future
version
If
the
answer
to
either
or
both
of
these
question
is
Yes
Firefox
will
become
just
too
irritate
to
use
I
hope
the
answer
to
both
is
No
because
any
other
answer
do
not
reflect
a
well
thoughtthrough
product
Alternative
to
LiveClick
for
Live
Bookmarks
I
use
Firefox
to
follow
a
ton
of
webcomics
and
love
be
able
to
see
on
my
bookmark
toolbar
if
a
comic
had
update
I
notice
this
functionality
had
gone
away
recently
and
when
I
looke
into
it
it
looke
like
this
functionality
was
actually
come
from
an
extension
call
LiveClick
Unfortunately
it
seem
LiveClick
is
not
compatible
beyond
Firefox
55
so
Im
ask
if
there
is
any
alternative
extension
or
native
functionality
to
give
me
back
what
I
lost
If
not
is
there
a
way
to
revert
to
version
55
permanently
This
is
all
I
am
use
Firefox
for
currently
so
without
this
I
would
probably
look
to
see
if
other
browser
have
a
similar
ability
as
it
is
a
pain
in
the
butt
to
check
every
single
bookmark
manually
to
see
what
has
update
Thanks
in
advance
for
any
suggestion

Connection
Failure
Hidden
Elements
Reveal
Clock
So
Ive
experience
the
issue
where
a
connection
is
supposedly
not
secure
or
configure
improperly
that
other
people
have
had
but
whenever
I
examine
the
hidden
element
of
the
error
page
it
say
that
the
website
did
not
connect
because
of
an
issue
with
my
computer
clock
There
is
no
issue
with
the
clock
so
I
was
wonder
what
this
answer
mean
In
addition
all
of
these
problem
are
with
website
configure
by
or
relate
to
one
particular
company
Even
the
company
account
on
LinkedIn
wont
open
despite
this
not
be
their
website
These
website
are
the
only
one
I
am
have
issue
with
Can
anyone
provide
any
insight
to
this
oddly
specific
problem
how
can
i
uninstall
the
read
fanatic
from
mozilla
i
dont
know
how
read
fanatic
is
download
in
my
app
now
give
me
solution
to
delete
it
permanently
from
my
app
nd
also
never
reinstall
would
be
done
How
do
I
get
FF
64
bit
for
my
Win
7
64
bit
system
My
PC
use
Win
Home
Premium
64
bit
I
notice
the
last
two
Updates
from
FF
install
the
32
bit
version
the
latest
be
V560
Prior
to
that
the
Updates
were
64
bit
I
have
no
idea
why
FF
change
my
Updates
to
32
bit
So
how
do
I
change
my
present
FF
32
bit
to
FF
64
bit
and
ensure
that
future
update
are
indeed
64
bit
It
might
not
be
relevant
but
I
also
use
Thunderbird
V523
for
email
Can
I
see
where
firefox
is
connect
when
load
a
page
I
really
want
to
know
how
a
page
is
be
load
and
what
ip
address
it
use
For
example
I
do
a
nslookup
on
page1com
and
it
return
an
ip
adress
like
1111
but
this
page
is
also
connect
and
load
from
other
ip
address
like
fontsgooglecom
to
load
external
font
or
load
java
code
from
other
ip
too
How
can
I
see
this
I
would
love
to
know
how
can
I
see
every
ip
address
that
one
website
load
This
would
be
very
helpful
to
unlock
website
on
my
firewall
I
use
endian
Thanks

Quantums

You
know

Firefoxs

use
to
look
like
this
httpsimgurcom7M17XsH
It
was
very
easy
to
use
and
also
quite
nice
to
look
at
Somehow
after
update
to
Firefox
Quantum
the
embed
player
look
like
this
httpsimgurcomnW5oVup
And
I
really
do
not
think
this
is
suppose
to
happen
I
cant
even
pause
or
navigate
the
audio
file
anymore
since
there
isnt
anything
to
click
My
Firefox
version
is

I
havent
even
change
any

that
would
explain

Before
anyone
ask
me
for
change
Ive
made
to
my
browser
I
literally
didnt
do
anything
before
the
update
All
of
my
legacy
addon
have
been
delete
so
none
of
them
have
any
effect
on
the
player
my
only
addon
are
UBlock
Origin
XKit
for
Tumblr
and
a
disable
Snaplinks
and
I
dont
have
custom
skin
or
template
I
cant
think
of
anything
that
could
make
the
player
look
like
a
green
progress
bar
at
least
not
anything
Ive
done
It
just
honestly
seem
like
a
bug
cause
by
the
Quantum
update
Also
just
as
a
sidenote
Quantum
claim
to
be
faster
than
any
other
Firefox
Really
Then
why
is
my
Quantum
slower
than
Firefox

Sometimes
I
have
to
load

What
has
gone
wrong
with
Firfox
and
dropdown
menus
Over
the
last
week
or
so
Firefoxs
handle
of
dropdown
menus
has
gone
I
mean
that
they
dont
appear
when
click
on
or
sometime
appear
but
can
take
several
to
many
minute
to
do
so
and
then
cant
be
scroll
through
This
is
a
pretty
major
drawback
for
web
use
I
this
the
result
of
a
recent
update
It
is
the
case
now
that
a
lot
of
site
and
organisation
are
not
bother
to
make
their
site
work
with
Firefox
Can
I
get
rid
of
the
current
version
of
firefox
and
go
back
to
one
a
few
issue
back
that
do
work
I
have
been
use
Firefox
and
it
predecessor
all
the
way
back
to
NCSA
mosaic
in
1992
but
if
I
cant
get
this
fix
it
will
have
to
be
goodbye
Mozilla
and
Internet
Explorer
andor
Chrome
will
have
won
out
in
the
end
Firefox
bookmark
search
match
not
only
bookmark
name
but
also
name
of
folder
and
subfolder
bookmark
are
stor
in
Firefox
has
a
nice
feature
that
typ
in
the
address
bar
search
the
bookmark
But
the
search
only
take
into
account
bookmark
name
ie
the
word
that
are
in
the
bookmark
name
The
question
to
Mozilla
Firefox
team
Firefox
user
are
encourage
to
help
by
click
I
have
this
problem
button
on
this
page
is
Can
you
add
to
the
bookmark
search
function
a
feature
of
match
also
the
word
in
the
name
of
the
bookmark
folder
ie
the
bookmark
path
for
a
particular
bookmark
in
addition
to
current
behavior
match
the
word
in
the
bookmark
name
Add
it
as
the
default
or
as
an
option
More
detail
Many
people
include
myself
a
organize
bookmark
into
folder
b
sometime
bookmark
the
open
tab
into
a
folder
use
Cmd+Shift+D
on
MacOS
Ctrl+Shift+D
on
Windows
In
both
case
typically
the
folder
are
name
use
representative
keyword
rather
than
label
the
individual
bookmark
which
would
be
time
consume
The
problem
here
is
that
bookmark
search
in
Firefox
do
not
account
for
the
keyword
in
the
folder
and
subfolder
of
the
path
under
which
individual
bookmark
are
stor
These
are
in
fact
virtual
folderspath
because
the
info
is
stor
in
a
database
placessqlite
but
the
folderspath
information
is
available
and
in
fact
it
is
use
by
Firefox
when
browse
the
bookmark
manually
By
the
way
it
seem
some
other
browser
such
as
Opera
have
such
capability
httpssupportmozillaorgenUSquestions966240
Also
there
have
been
some
addon
for
a
similar
function
but
those
are
usually
not
maintain
for
long
or
do
not
work
well

How
do
I
disable
the
Customize
Firefox
with
Addons
pop
up
I
recently
came
back
to
Firefox
after
a
stint
with
Chrome
The
reason
I
change
from
Firefox
to
Chrome
was
that
the
last
version
of
FF
that
I
use
this
was
about
2
year
ago
was
get
bog
down
while
browse
and
it
would
freeze
my
PC
when
I
close
the
browser
window
Now
Chrome
has
been
have
issue
with
Facebook
and
I
decid
to
switch
back
to
my
old
Favorite
Low
and
behold
the
first
thing
I
see
is
a
pop
up
I
Hate
pop
up
tel
me
to
Customize
my
Firefox
with
Addons
I
thought
oh
well
that
must
be
for
first
time
user
and
close
it
out
The
next
time
I
open
the
browser
it
pop
up
again
sigh
I
hit
the
Browse
Addons
button
even
though
I
already
had
all
the
addon
I
need
I
just
want
the
pop
up
to
stop
er
pop
up
No
luck
Almost
every
time
I
open
the
browser
I
get
the
same
stupid
message
Now
I
dont
mind
Firefox
communicate
with
me
when
it
need
to
tell
me
something
important
but
this
pop
up
should
have
some
kind
of
Yes
I
get
the
message
or
be
disable
once
I
click
on
the
Browse
Addons
button
That
neither
of
these
is
the
case
worry
me
Its
seem
at
least
to
my
memory
to
be
a
very
unFirefoxlike
thing
for
Firefox
to
do
Firefox
use
the
be
the
Cool
One
of
the
browser
bunch
Pushing
the
envelope
raise
Establishment
eyebrow
and
mak
fan
by
give
the
user
who
care
for
that
kind
of
thing
the
ability
to
change
almost
every
aspect
of
the
browser
This
seem
like
something
that
one
of
the
uncool
one
ie
Internet
Explorer
would
do
because
they
dont
trust
user
to
have
the
intelligence
to
do
something
that
would
add
to
their
browse
experience
I
never
expect
some
thing
like
this
from
Firefox
ever
Since

Mac
OS

Sierra

vertical
slide

vertical
slider
bar
is
not
present
on
some
web
site
like
MyYahoo
but
it
is
present
on
other

I
upgrad

more
then
a

usually
some

cause

about
5
second
for
either

During

reference
but
there
is
no

httpsdxrmozillaorgmozillareleasesearchq=domselect_popup_in_parentenabledredirect=false
I
know
this

was
ad
sometime

scrollbar
if
the

Setting
the

to
`true`
correct
the
behavior
and
the
dropdown
popup
shift
toward
the
left
to

How
to
change
icon
of
bookmark
folder
in
57+
So
up
until
FF57
I
use
an
extension
xpi
call
FavIconChanger
that
work
for
this
purpose
eg
I
would
rightclick
on
a
folder
in
the
bookmark
toolbar
or
the
library
as
well
and
in
the
popup
context
menu
would
be
a
line
for
chang
the
icon
This
would
apply
to
both
URL
and
Folders
by
the
way
It
would
then
have
a
dialog
box
that
would
allow
me
to
choose
a
ico
or
image
file
to
upload
It
was
fantastic
I
had
special
folder
icon
in
the
toobar
without
any
letter
next
to
the
folder
In
57+
I
am
use
Nightly
58
all
these
legacy
extension
are
dead
of
course
That
extension
had
stop
be
update
in
2014
and
there
appear
nothing
close
to
it
So
sad
This
was
one
of
the
main
reason
I
commit
to
Firefox
over
chrome
because
Chrome
would
not
allow
this
either
although
IE
alway
did
remember
that
thing
An
extension
would
be
nice
but
if
there
is
a
harder
workaround
that
achieve
it
that
would
be
acceptable
Thanks

Keyword
search
is
one
of
the
best
thing
that
happen
to
quantum
firefox
However
search

doesnt
go
with
the

that
I
choose

Instead
it
choose
default

If
user
enter

to
use
different

it
make
sense
to
suggest
from
the

Why
do
Firefox
keep
sign
me
out
of
webpage
While
I
accept
that
it
make
sense
to
refresh
your
password
why
is
it
necessary
for
Firefox
to
sign
me
out
of
every
site
every
so
often
I
believe
that
some
site
insist
that
you
sign
out
and
back
again
after
42
day
or
whatever
but
Firefox
has
been
go
way
further
than
that
Not
long
ago
Firefox
upgrad
itself
it
seem
and
suddenly
I
found
that
my
front
page
had
been
revert
to
Firefox
home
page
that
all
my
save
favourite
had
disappear
and
that
Id
been
sign
out
of
everything
The
reversion
to
Firefox
home
page
and
the
loss
of
my
favourite
hasnt
happen
again
but
since
then
Ive
twice
now
been
suddenly
sign
out
everywhere
the
latest
event
happen
today
only
a
week
or
so
after
the
last
logout
event
Why
Why
cant
I
control
my
own
existence
How

a

Im
pretty
sure
that
there
was
such
a
button
before
I
update

A
of
now
the
only
way
to

is

Change
the
default
background
color
For
year
I
had
an
addon
that
made
the
default
background
color
of

black
with

write
After
a
recent
update
that
was
all
gone
I
can
apply
plenty
of
theme
that
make
the
header
black
but
I
want
the
page
background
and
the
bookmark
sidebar
black
as
well

The

is
a

of

blue
white
I
have
no
idea
what
it
mean
or
why
it
is
there
All
else
seem
to
be
as

I
have
check
info
on

but
havent

anything
about

Perhaps
Ive

in

I

then
please
excuse

How
can
I
SET
FOCUS
to
alwaysdisplay
bookmark
sidebar
I
know
I
can
do
it
with
the
mouse
obviously
my
question
is
about
do
it
WITHOUT
move
the
mouse
Also
my
question
is
NOT
about
the
toggle
showhide
the
sidebar
Also
depend
on
the
web
page
youre
on
fiddle
around
with
TAB
backtab
by
shifttab
is
NOT
reliable
since
it
not
predictable
how
MANY
shifttab
youll
need
to
get
the
focus
there
And
y
I
do
NOT
want
to
just
try
how
many
you
need
in
each
case
Id
like
to
make
a
1key
macro
so
it
has
to
be
predictable
Up
to
some
week
earlier
the
shortcut
alt
set
focus
to
the
searchline
within
the
bookmark
sidebar
then
a
forward
tab
switch
focus
from
that
bookmark
searchline
to
the
first
entry
within
the
bookmark
list
so
with
this
2step
macro
I
could
build
a
1key
command
in
the
latest
flavor
of
FF
the
alt
do
NOT
work
anymore
Im
so
fed
up
with
developer
cripple
software
from
one
version
to
the
next
instead
of
amend
it
and
that
for
software
paid
or
free
I
use
the
js__isotope_item
jquery
to
view
a
set
of
image
and
text
But
it
display
unnecessary
gap
between
two
data
item
in
firefox
browser
The
above
jquery
is
use
to
display
a
set
of
item
But
it
display
unneceassary
gap
between
two
data
set
This
work
well
in
Chrome
Its
really
great
if
someone
can
provide
a
development
solution

them
from
the
Recently
Closed
Tabs
menu
under
History
and
if
there
any
pattern
to
the
position
they
reappear
in
I
have
yet
to
discover
it
Often
they
do
open
where
they
were
before
I
close
them
but
Ive
also
seen
them
open
in
the
last
tab
to
the
left
of
the
current
tab
and
to
the
right
of
the
current
tab
So
Im
curious
Does
anyone
know
where
recently
close
tab
are
suppose
to
reopen
And
is
there
by
any
chance
an
aboutconfig
preference
that
control
this
In
Facebook
the
video
are
chang
to
a
full
cor
screen
the
sound
is
good
I
made
that
complain
3
time
already
with
each
new
update
I
test
firefox
and
get
very
disappoint
I
am
uninstal
and
try
again
in
10
year
and
maybe
htaccess
redirect
from
www
to
nonwww
not
work
in
Firefox
My
website
has
SSL
certificate
install
on
httpsicewarriorcom
I
have
set
up
a
htaccess
redirect
from
httpswwwicewarriorcom
to
httpsicewarriorcom
which
work
in
all
other
browser
apart
from
Firefox
My
redirect
is
as
follow
RewriteCond

Any

to
why
Firefox

this
and
what
I
can
do
to
solve
it

etc
I
am
not

to
log
out

account
when
i
click
on
my
profile
which
we
usually
click
to

except

in

like
crome
and
explorer
I
it
possible
to
add
image
to
headersfooter
when
print
with
Firefox
Now
that
headless
Firefox
is
out
I
would
like
to
replace
my
Phantomjs
service
for
print
PDFdocuments
and
use
Firefox
instead
But
to
do
so
I
would
need
Firefox
to
be
able
to
print
image
in
the
headersfooter
section
so
I
am
now
ask
if
this
is
somehow
possible
I
try
put
Html
tag
in
the
custom
section
when
print
but
it
only
print
out
as
text
I
try
to
google
this
but
couldnt
find
any
answer
so
I
am
very
thankful
for
all
support
What
is
the
Best
Firefox
Fork
I
have
been
a
loyal
and
dedicate
Firefox
user
as
long
as
I
can
remember
What
alway
made
Firefox
the
best
for
me
was
the
same
thing
that
made
Windows
beat
other
rival
and
the
same
thing
that
made
the
iPhone
a
success
THE
APPS
Now
it
seem
that
Firefox
is
move
in
a
direction
I
cannot
follow
V58
or
whatever
they
are
cal
it
So
with
each
new
release
I
am
find
Firefox
more
and
more
unstable
runaway
memory
leak
that
take
just
5
minute
to
use
all
memory
on
my
system
and
then
crash
Firefox
and
worse
than
anything
my
trust
firefox
extension
are
stoppong
work
Well
I
cant
take
anymore
Either
I
freeze
Firefox
and
keep
all
my
extension
in
a
relatively
stable
environment
or
I
use
a
fork
of
Firefox
I
would
rather
stay
with
Firefox
I
must
prepare
for
the
alternative
because
it
seem
to
me
that
the
power
that
be
seem
determine
to
wreck
it
with
this
directional
change
So
can
anyone
advise
which
fork
are
worth
consider
Do
any
of
them
support
the
exist
extension
platform
I
am
sorry
this
is
not
consider
an
appropriate
question
if
it
is
delete
I
will
ask
it
elsewhere
on
other
forums
I
have
consider
even
write
a
blog
about
the
demise
of
Firefox
It
make
me
really
sad
to
see
it
ruine
in
this
way
Firefox
leave
lot
of
part
file
in
my
download
folder
Whenever
I
download
a
file
depend
on
the
file
type
I
get
several
part
file
which
do
not
get
cleane
up
This
has
happen
for
at
least
the
last
four
month
and
has
happen
regardless
of
whether
I
use
the
Download
Status
Bar
addon
which
I
recently
install
to
give
me
a
download
bar
like
chrome
has
I
cant
find
anything

to
this
set
In
case

the
permission
on
my
download
folder

Fx
can

write
to
it

How
do
I
incorporate
Tor
into
Firfox
The
info
on
the
incorporation
is
sketchy
at
best
Will
you
please
clarify
In
the
present
climate
it
is
vital
to
protect
oneself
and
it
would
seem
that
Tor
is
the
most
effective
program
available
at
this
time
so
I
must
go
with
the
web
client
that
has
it
Yours

use
the
Mozilla

year
Lately
when
I

or
two
and
then
continue
This
cause
error
in
typ
as
the
character

not
catch
up
to
my

entry
It
is
very
annoy
and
has
gotten
to
the
point
that
I
was
force
to
switch
to
Chrome
which
do
not
have
this
issue
What
Ive
try

far
to
resolve

Please
make

I
do
have
the
official

of

I
have
try

the

had
said
about
toggle

off

also
try
to

however
above
the
Shockwave
Flash
it
say
Shockwave
Flash
is
known
to
be
vulnerable
and
should
be
update
I
try
to
update
it
multiple
time
but
it
alway
come
to
the
same

which
tell
me
that

case

be
able

I
dont
know
how
else
to
fix
this
problem
How
can
I
configure
Firefox
to
print
to
searchable
pdf
I
believe
this
is
a
really
useful
feature
I
dont
want
the
pdf
to
be
just
an
image
where
I
cannot
copy
the
text
Most
of
the
time
word
are
render
as
graphics
Very
seldom
do
I
find
that
text
can
be
selectable
Currently
Chrome
do
a
much
better
job
of
create
a
pdf
with
searchable
text
I
can
then
search
for
keyword
in
my
collection
of
pdf
file
Im
use
PDF
Creator
Maybe
Firefox
could
implement
a
Save
as
PDF
function
just
like
Chrome
Another
advantage
is
accessibility
where
text
can
be
dictate
by
onscreen
reader
for
our
visually
challenge
friend
Firefox

Making

more

Would
it
be
possible
to
allow
the
find
option
to
return
result
like
”rață”
or
”rată”
if
the

search
term
is
”rata”
It
should
also
work

OWA
Webmail
not
work
properly
Hotmail
seem
fine
but
my
work
email
which
I
believe
use
OWA
and
look
more
like
actual
Outlook
once
open
has
very
little
functionality
I
read
an
email
it
mark
itself
as
read
within
a
minute
or
two
it
goe
back
to
Unread
status
I
try
and
delete
and
email
and
I
get
an
error
message
on
screen
attach
which
doesnt
give
any
information
I
can
see
of
be
use
to
anybody
This
behavior
is
the
same
on
my
personal
laptop
run
Ubuntu
Studio
1604
and
on
the
work
laptop
run
Windows

Webmail
work
fine
on
the
work
laptop
when

Not
try
on

Once
connect
to

server
the

look
as

so
definitely
a
owa
configure

Obviously
Im
not
the

administrator
so
cant
action
change
on
that
end
most
likely
I
had
recently
attempt
to
migrate
to
Opera
on
my
personal
machine
but
found
too
many
niggl
with
it
so
have
come
back
to
Firefox
I
would
prefer
be
able
to
stick
with
this
rather
than
have
to
change
browser
I
only
have
one
single
extension
install
AdBlock
Plus
and
disable
this
made
no
difference
After
upgrade
to
Firefox
56
the
javascript
object
for
a
form
element
without
action
is
different
I
notice
that
the
follow

behave
differently
before

The
problem
of
Ebay
page
not
redirect
has
been
around
and
signall
since
2013
I
anything
be
done
about
it
Clicking
on
link
or
item
in
Ebay
sometime
frequently
give
an
error
message
The
page
isn’t
redirect
properly
There
is
a
forum
go
with
this
problem
and
if
I
Google
the
issue
there
is
a
handful
of
question
with
the
same
content
since
2013
And
only
answer
that
dont
work
like
clear
the
cache
or
clean
out
cookee
Given
that
Ebay
is
one
of
the
more
frequently
visit
website
I
am
surprise
that
it
hasnt
been
structurally
fix
between
2013
and
now
Are
anyone
aware
of
a
proper
fix
Twitter
doesnt
work
properly
on
FireFox
Hello
since
a
few
day
ago
and
after
when
I
reinstall
window
10
I
have
problem
with
twitter
again
the
same
thing
happen
to
me
the
last
time
I
install
window
and
after
a
few
day
without
understand
why
it
solve
for
itself
The
first
problem
is
that
I
can
not
favorite
any
tweet
by
click
on
the
heart
icon
when
I
do
it
nothing
happen
the
heart
icon
blink
for
a
second
and
then
nothing
the
second
problem
is
that
I
can
not
retweet
when
I
click
on
retweet
icon
a
box
appear
then
when
click
on
retweet
it
say
Failed
to
Retweet
Please
try
again
later
everything
ok
on
Chrome
and
Opera
what
should
I
do
Dev
tool
Debugger
Sources
not
show
all
the
resource
Save
Page
A
Problem
How
I
encounter
this
In
the
website
Im
Viewing
httpwwwkodercombounties
In
their
server
they
configure
to
be
alway
redirect
to
bounty
But
when
I
Save
Page
A
to
download
all
the
page
content
to
my
local
I
notice
the
icon
arent
work
for
me
I
try
to
use
chrome
to
Save
A
too
but
the
icon
arent
work
too
So
I
try
to
checkout
what
source
are
load
in
the
browser
via
dev
tool
in
Firefox
Problem
1
not
show
all
the
resource
In
the
Firefox
dev
tool
I
saw
something
like
this
httpsiimgurcomB7FpL14png
Its
only
show
the
directory
tree
for
JavaScript
which
I
found
no
way
to
clearly
see
what
all
the
file
structure
is
or
even
find
the
font
file
In
chrome
at
least
I
can
see
the
file
structure
logically
and
checkout
the
font
file
really
exist
httpsiimgurcomjUNxoPCpng
Problem
2
Save
Page
A
not
download
all
the
resource
A
you
can
see
the
resource
config
on
their
server
made
them
have
to
write
something
like
`
src
urlfontsstackinterfaceeot33839631`
to
access
the
resource
on
the
server
httpsiimgurcomAeHyibEpng
But
both
of
the
Save
Page
A
utility
in
Firefox
or
Chrome
work
in
a
way
that
save
the
project
in
a
different
file
structure
and
modify
all
the
path
to
the
new
file
structure
I
know
this
is
for
convenience
reason
you
can
download
it
start
open
it
as
the
same
no
need
to
configure
But
theyre
not
download
the
font
file
in
httpwwwkodercomthemesv2fontssociconttf
Ill
have
to
download
them
all
by
the
structure
I
saw
in
Chrome
and
hardcode
the
url
to
get
all
the
resource
I
think
this
should
be
something
that
logical
to
add

Even
after
mute
a

why
is
the
audio
from
tab
still
be
play
Hi
there
I
usually
play
some
game
on
Facebook
like
DragonCity
etc
What
I
notice
recently
that
sometime
even
after
mute
the
DragonCity
tab
it
keep
on
play
audio
and
after
mute
it
again
it
start
play
audio
again
after
some
timethe
second
one
is
a
bit
more
random
I
this
a
bug
because
it
didnt
happen
in
previous
version
of
Firefox
Im
currently
use
version
560
Em
minha
empresa
estou
tentando
utilizar
um
balanceador
para
realizar
SSLi
porém
o
firefox
retorna
o
erro
sec_error_ca_cert_invalid
Como
permitir
esse
acesso
Utilizo
o
A10
para
fazer
o
SSLi
então
instalei
um
certificado
auto
assinado
no
Firefox
para
que
ele
feche
SSL
com
o
Balanceador
porém
devido
ao
Firefox
ter
uma
biblioteca
própria
de
certificado
para
exatamente
evitar
um
maninthemidle
o
navegador
bloqueia
as
conexõ
HTTPS
informando
que
o
certificado
é
inválido
Gostaria
que
o
Firefox
utilizasse
o
certificado
instalado
sem
bloquear
as
conexõ
Desde
já
agradeço
In
my
company
I
am
try
to
use
a
balancer
to
perform
SSLi
however
firefox
return
the
error
sec_error_ca_cert_invalid
How
to
allow
this
access
I
use
A10
to
do
SSLi
so
I
install
a
self
sign
certificate
in
Firefox
so
that
it
close
SSL
with
the
balancer
but
because
Firefox
has
it
own
library
of
certificate
to
exactly
avoid
a
maninthemidle
the
browser
block
HTTPS
connection
state
that
the
certificate
is
invalid
I
would
like
Firefox
to
use
the
install
certificate
without
block
the
connection
Thank
you
very
much
in
advance

How
to
block
program
such
as
Omniture
I
value
my
internet
privacy
and
have
my
computer
set
up
with
adbloc
as
well
as
to
block
3rd
party
cooky
and
to
delete
cooky
at
the
end
of
the
session
I
also
delete
history
on
a
daily
basis
However
when
I
look
at
the
Weather
Channel
website
I
see
a
list
of
my
previous
city
search
I
did
some
internet
search
and
it
seem
I
am
the
only
one
puzzl
by
this
I
search
the
Weather
Channel
site
and
found
a
reference
to
Omniture
which
put
a
cookie
on
your
computer
that
apparently
cant
be
block
unless
you
create
a
cookie
that
is
erase
when
you
erase
cooky
so
a
no
win
situation
I
there
a
solution
to
this
Obviously
I
could
stop
use
this
weather
info
site
but
it
is
unlikely
they
are
the
only
one
do
this
and
I
believe
they
also
own
another
popular
weather
site

How
to
run
on
demand
the
32bit
version
of
Firefox
after
the
5601
update
I
use
to
run
both
32bit
and
64bit
build
of
Firefox
under
Windows
7
64bit
by
use
different
shortcut
point
to
their
different
installation
folder
ProgramFiles
and
ProgramFilesx86
Since
the
5601
update
the
x86
shortcut
end
up
launch
the
64bit
version
Looking
at
the
executable
it
appear
that
the
64bit
build
was
install
into
the
x86
folder
replac
the
32bit
build
This
obviously
defeat
Windows’
scheme
of
have
separate
folder
for
32bit
build
and
64bit
build
and
that
strike
me
as
poorly
thought
out
In
any
case
I
want
to
restore
the
ability
of
run
both
build
on
demand
If
I
reinstall
the
32bit
build
as
advise
on
support
page
httpssupportmozillaorgenUSkb64bitmigrationoptout
then
   1
Can
this
be
an
installation
over
the
exist
5601
installation
64bit
build
in
the
x86
folder
as
describe
above
Or
is
prior
uninstallation
require
   2
Will
instal
the
5601
32bit
version
have
any
effect
on
the
original
64bit
version
in
the
64bit
folder
still
at
version
560
For
example
cause
it
to
be
uninstall
or
to
stop
work
or
to
stop

update
etc

Suggested
alternative
to

in
truly
SINGLE

once
MAFF
is
discontinue
Just
got
the
note
that
save
a
website
to
a
single
file
such
as
MHT
or
MHTML
is
no
longer
support
after
Nov
chromemafcontentintegrationconvertPagexhtml
The
Save
as
single
html
option
alway
create
an
html
PLUS
the
annoy
folder
_files
with
everything
else
This
make
it
unnecessarily
difficult
to
move
save
page
around
or
to
share
those
It
is
important
to
be
able
to
save
a
complete
snapshot
with
original
web
link
and
timestamp
due
to
the
dynamic
nature
of
many
website
WHAT
OPTION
DOES
Firefox
offer
to
save
web
page
into
a
single
file
again
that
can
be
open
w
FF
and
other
browser
What
would
be
the
problem
to
eg
combine
the
single
html
PLUS
the
_files
folder
into
an
archive
as
w
MAFF
The
suggest
Save
Page
WE
extension
doesnt
quite
fit
that
bill
Maybe
I
have
configure
it
wrong
or
use
the
wrong
option
Save
Complete
Page
sometime
still
leave
a
few
content
item
out
Also
I
very
much
like
the
origin
link
and
timestamp
at
the
top
of
a
page
when
open
an
mht
or
mhtml
file
the
new
notification
bar
which
has
to
be
activate
manually
for
the
new
Save
Page
WE
extension
no
longer
show
the
link
to
the
original
at
the
time
of
save
the
single
html
file
Finally
several
page
cannot
be
save
this
way
Save
Page
WE
cannot
be
use
with
this
page
I
agree
w
a
couple
of
other
poster
why
try
to
fix
what
has
been
a
stronghold
of
FireFox
for
over
a
decade
it
great
addon
and
extension
esp
the
ability
to
save
a
web
page
to
a
SINGLE
file
This
ability
truly
made
me
settle
on
FF
as
my
favorite
and
default
browser
ever
since
it
became
available
Please
let
us
know
of
a
better
simple
alternative
andor
intention
to
fix
the
Save
Page
WE
extension
to
match
the
capability
of
the
save
as
MHT
w
MAFF
Or
better
please
revert
your
decision
to
abandon

at

keep

do

How

note
I

that

my
question
Prior
to

56
it
seem
like
all
custom
HTML5
video
player
except
Flash
respect
the
Windows
perapp
volume
level
set
for

If
I
set
my
Firefox
and
Flash
volume
really
low
in

I
could
rest
assure
the
volume
would
alway
be
low
After
the
56
upgrade
it
seem
like
every
custom
HTML5
player
has
it
own
custom
volume
level
Not
only
do
the
player
not
respect
the
perapp
level
volume
of
Window
it
default
to
100
volume
and
doesnt
have
an
applevel
volume
to
adjust
It
seem
to
me
that
if
I
set
Firefoxs
applevel
volume
to
a
particular
level
all
sound
made
by
the
app
should
respect
that
audio
level
I
there
any
way
to
make
that
happen

do
not
display
FULL
content
on
a
few
of
my
prefer
site
Ive
notice
it
on
ebay
and
Tmobile
so
far
So
on
ebay
example
site
httpswwwebaycomitmVoltgardRubberInsulatingBlanketElectricalShockSafetyArcFlash36x36272730840625ssPageName=STRK3AMEBIDX3AIT_trksid=p2055119m1438l2649
when
view
a
single
item
to
buybid
on
there
is
a
white
drop
down
box
MISSING
that
is
suppose
to
say
Add
to
list
directly
below
the
Blue
Add
to
cart
boxbutton
Now
at
that
location
all
I
see
is
a
White
boxbutton
that
say
Watch
or
Unwatch
for
every
other
button
push
and
it
never
give
me
the
option
to
Add
to
list
as
it
did
before
today
login
On
TMobile
example
site
httpsmytmobilecomspoke
I
went
there
today
to
make
a
payment
and
all
my
save
payment
cc
info
was
gone
and
when
I
reenter
it
in
the
form
manually
I
kept
get
an
error
message
from
TM
say
to
Enter
a
VALID
cc
so
I
reenter
many
time
use
2
different
ccard
and
still
alway
got
the
very
same
error
message
say
to
Enter
a
VALID
cc
So
to
trouble
shoot
the
problem
I
temporarily
switch
over
to
Chrome
also
to
Microsoft
Edge
they
both
work
fine
show
all
the
miss
content
that
FF
did
not
AND
accept
bot
my
cc

as
valid
This
tell
me
the
problem
is
in
my
FF
and
not
the
2
website
is
that
not
correct
Having
an
easy
way
to
edit
search
bar
engine
URL
would
be
VERY
nice
In
previous
version
it
could
be
edit
manually
in
the
Profiles
folder
Now
it
is
a
binary
file
there
is
no
way
to
update
the
search
URL
In
most
case
we
just
would
need
to
append
a
search
query
to
an
URL
In
most
case
these
URL
can
change
when
the
site
update
When

Tried

to
the
main
page
area
In
firefox
before
version
57
I
can
leave
address
input
and
return
main
page
area
after
press
ESC
this
is
usefull

like
it
But

scroll
any
of
the
ingame
menus
and
list
and
chat
plus
all
the
other
mouse
wheel
usage
mak
the
issue
very
inconvenient
it
not
work
at
all
I
try
the
game
on
Edge
browser
in
it
there
wasnt
that
problem
On
my
other
computer
with
Windows
7
and
again
on
Mozilla
Firefox
the
game
is
work
just
fine
Also
when
I
play
sometime

work
for
a
few
second

case
Any

Now
when
I
try
to
start
Firefox

sometime
it
will

a
few
minute
or
hour
before
crash
The
crash

Why
is
my
default
printer
chang
when
click
embed
print
link
I
have
change
my
aboutconfig
set
printsave_print_settings
to
false
and
this
is
work
to
insure
that
under
most
circumstance
Firefox
is
print
to
my
system
default
printer
But
I
still
have
an
issue
with
it
default
to
the
wrong
printer
when
I
click
a
print
button
that
is
embed
in
a
web
page
For
example
if
I
am
on
webmail
and
it
has
a
print
button
or
from
my
bank
website
that
has
a
print
button
etc
I
have
try
refresh
my
firefox
profile
as
well
as
completely
delet
the
profile
as
well
as
profilesini
and
reinstal
firefox
I
also
ran
Revo
uninstaller
and
had
it
do
a
full
uninstall
Yet
when
I
click
a
print
button
in
a
website
it
alway
select
the
same
incorrect
printer
that
is
not
my
system
default
printer
This
is
an
issue
because
the
printer
it
is
select
is
a
label
printer
and
it
spit
out
doz
of
label
or
more
and
many
user
dont
realize
it
default
to
the
wrong
printer
in
those
instance
and
we
are
wast
many
many
label
